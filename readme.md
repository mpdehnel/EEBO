# EEBO-TCP Hacking

### Martin Dehnel-Wild, Katriel Cohn-Gordon, Reuben Cohn-Gordon.

Basic idea is as follows:

* Take the EEBO text data.
* Strip out the text from the .xml files, giving just a list of words with no punctuation or cruft. (strip2.py)
* For each word: convert it to modern English, using MorphAdorner
* For the modern equivalents, shove it through the etymwn Etymological Dictionary thing to get the closest (non-English) language to which it's related
* Attach the year of publication of the text to the result
* Produce some nice statistics / visualisations on the percentage of words from different etymological backgrounds over time.
* ???
* Profit
