diuine are due Or doe to you by Positiue accrew These mysteries I leaue to sound Diuines That searched haue profundest Scripturemines Seditious superstitious Nouelties I hate my mind I onely exercise In your pure easie sweet diuinest notions And them at leasure suit to my deuotions To Iohn a Nokes THou likst my Verses well but not to flatter Dislikst Diuinitie should be my matter What now will Lawiers turne Diuines thats braue No By no meanes They haue no soules to saue THE BRIDES ORNAMENTS MEDITAT I Of Heauenly KNOWLEDGE A Daily warfare is a Christians life Where Souldiers all not onely stand in need Of Armes and Valour to maintaine the strife The cursed Serpent makes with Adams seed But of this Treasure Knowledge both to feed Their Soules with food most pure Celestiall And furnish with such Weapons as they need I therefore her Loues Treasurer doe call For we in daily want stand of her Treasure all By feigned Treasure did the Serpent traine Our two first Parents to their cursed sinne Pretending they should goodly treasure gaine And Knowledge both of good and euill win But good doth end where euill doth begin For drosse they doe exchange their purest gold The Serpent bad without themselues within They find the euill as the Serpent told But vp to Heavn flies good which can no ill behold Thus all our Treasures lost we had before The Knowledge of Gods nature and his will And we become vnarmd rude naked poore Of all things ignorant but doing ill Now vs our enemies may easily kill We hauing lost our weapons and our treasure Which wealth and weapons if regaine we will We must attend this heaunly Ladys pleasure Diuine sweet Knowledge not confind by weight or measure Thou Word incarnate whom aright to know Is Life eternall Ioy and happy rest To mee this Ladies wondrous Beautie show And richest treasures which in golden Chest Thou hidst from Hell and malice of the Beast Knowledge containd in either Testament Wherein thy Will and Nature is exprest How we should liue and Serpents sting preuent How conquer Hell and serue thee with a true intent Some Knowledge call thhabit of demonstration Some her to know by causes doe define Some thvnderstandings sound determination Wee her to heaunly Doctrine here confine Which in a threefold Booke to man doth shine Of Creatures first and latter Testament The Booke of Creatures shewes Gods power diuine The Law is much in types and shadowes spent Whereof the Gospel is the full accomplishment In Booke of creatures all men may obserue Gods Wisdome Goodnesse Power and Prouidence By which he made the world and doth preserue In truest motions its circumference Sending from Heavn raines sweetest influence Filling our hearts with Mirth and Ioyfulnesse And giuing all things Motion Being Sense This doth Gods power and Godhead plaine expresse But not his Will which leads to endlesse happinesse Yet by this Booke are left without excuse Idolaters who downe to stocks doe fall Which their owne hands haue made for such abuse And leaue their Maker blessed ouer all Who as his Power and Goodnesse generall Appeares most plainly in this Worlds Creation So doth his gracious Bountie on them fall In sending food for daily sustentation And in their healths and liues continuall preseruation The next two Bookes most plainly doe disclose Gods will particular and generall Particular to Patriarchs Prophets those That till Christs time on God aright did call For this did not on all the Nations fall Gods will was then in Iury onely knowne But now the Gospel soundeth out to all The seed thereof in eury Nations sowne Which doth reueale hid mysteries before vnknowne The first Gods power and prouidence doth shew The second types out our Regeneration The third directly leadeth vs to know All that is needfull for our owne Saluation Evn from Election to Glorification This Booke reueales all secret mysteries Hidden in Christ before the Worlds foundation Though worldlings this as folly doe despise Yet this true Knowledge onely happy makes and wise As some great Princes might and Maiestie Is often to the meanest stranger knowne But his most secret counsell and decree To friends and counsellours is onely showne Evn so the King of Kings holds not vnknowne From Heathens sight his Maiestie and might But hath disclosed onely to his owne The secret of his counsells and delight Whereby they may him worship please and serue aright This is the Knowledge which I seeke to trace This onely doth true happinesse affoord Whereof the onely cause is inward Grace And vnderstanding Gods most holy Word The helpes which humane Learning doe record Law History Arts Physicke Poetrie Are but as seruants waiting on their Lord And handmaids to their dame Diuinitie All Knowledge without this is foolish vanitie Sweet Grace which dost true Knowledge of Gods will To Babes and sucklings oftentimes reueale When from great Clerkes of Wisdome and deepe skill Thy pleasure is this treasure to conceale Oh sacred breath which in our hearts doth steale Like sweetest Zephyrus most pleasing wind Whence no man knowes yet doth it surely seale That certaine Knowledge which I seeke to find Knowledge of God and Christ the Sauiour of mankind All Graces that doe serue Loues Royall Queene From heauenly Knowledge haue their maintenance And alwayes in her company are seene None without Knowledge may neere Loue aduance With her are Diligence and Temperance True Faith so neere her euer doth attend You would her take for Knowledge at a glance Though often Faith doth so her selfe transcend That shee beyond the reach of Knowledge doth ascend Not Faith alone but Workes accompany True Knowledge who in words doth make profession He knowes God but in Workes doth him deny Is evn a lyar by his owne confession How many from this rule doe make digression That would in Knowledge be accounted high But giue themselues to Pride Lust and Oppression Enuy dissembling Schisme Idolatry Alas true Knowledge neuer kept such company Some onely seeke to know that they may know And this is foolish curiositie And some of Learning make a goodly show And this is base and idle vanitie Some Knowledge seeke for their vtilitie Or their preferment which is filthy gaine Some to teach other which is Charitie Some by this Knowledge seeke Heavn to attaine To know and walke not right is damnable and vaine I liken this true Knowledge to the flower Or blossome springing from the root of Grace That doth most gloriously adorne Loues bower And fills with pleasant odours all the place Which blossome beautifull in little space It selfe into most goodly fruits doth spend Faith Mercy Peace each good and perfect grace Which fruit so farre the flower doth transcend God Men and Angels tast it and the same commend As Blossomes doe not from root liuely spring That after blowing haue a fruitlesse fall So Knowledge that in Workes is vanishing Had neuer any root from grace at all But is like to good seed thats said to fall From sowers hand downe by the highway side Whose rooting being shallow loose and small Could not the Suns hot scorching heat abide But in the blade with some small light affliction dide Some liken heaunly Knowledge to the Sunne Then which in this world nothing more to sight Obiected is But we by Sinne become Like him borne blind depriud of naturall light Till some Power supernaturall enlight And though more plaine in this world nothings showne Than Gods eternall Godhead goodnesse might Yet vntill Grace enlighten tis vnknowne No cause hereof in God but in our selues is knowne Knowledge is like the talents which the Lord When he went forth did to his seruants lend The first who his one talent vp did hoard Like him that for his Knowledge doth contend But therewith not himselfe nor others mend Hee that with talents two gaind other twaine Is he that doth his time and labour spend To saue himselfe and those with him remaine But he that gaind the fiue seeks all mens soules to gaine I Knowledge to the Virgins Lamps compare Which foolish maids had common with the Wise Oile workes of Pietie and Mercy are Which foolish Virgins idlely doe misprise But when one Loe the Bridegrome comes out cryes The foolish Virgins Lamps are spent and done Wherefore they must to merits merchandize And borrow when they of their owne haue none The Churches Treasury will furnish evry one Like Widowes Oile that doth encrease by spending Like flames that lightning others gaine more light Like Vsurers coine that doth augment by lending Like Ioy that most encreaseth by delight Like Manna that the Angels food is hight Whereof each gathers what may him suffice Except such as in Fleshpots more delight Like Springs which more you draw the faster rise Like Tutors who by teaching Schollers grow more wise No Simile can her so well expresse As infinite and boundlesse treasury Or Sea of waters which become no lesse Though Fountaines all with streames it doth supply How infinite is this grand mystery To lay of nothing this huge Worlds foundation One God three persons in the Trinitie Oh depth of Knowledge Gods owne Incarnation Obedience Passion Resurrection Exaltation Oh I am drownd here Elephants may swim My Lambelike Muse in shallow Fords must wade And seeke for Knowledge to desist from Sinne And make Faith Mercy Pietie my trade By Faith I know Christs merits mine are made The rest arefruits of my Sanctification Abundant Knowledge doth with sorrow lade To Know and doe Gods willis delectation And onely by Christs merits bringeth to Saluation This is the Knowledge which our Sauiour meant When as he it eternall life did call To know God and the Christ which he had sent This is the Knowledge so much sought of all Before and since the Law and euer shall Though till Christs time it was so shadowed As couerd it in types and signes seemd small But since Times fulnesse is accomplished Behold they all in Christ are easie to be read By this did Abel offer of his Sheepe The fat and God accepted his oblation By this so well Gods Law did Henoch keepe Hee him exalted from earths habitation For this did Abram Ieaue both house and Nation Assured that from out his Loines should spring That Knowledge which to know was his saluation Herein did Dauid though he were a King Take more delight than Crowne or any worldly thing See next his royall sonne King Salomon Then whom arise a Wiser neuer shall Who knew plants natures eun from Lebanon Her Caedars tall to Hysope by the wall Who as in Wealth in Knowledge passed all Yet after hee had traced Uanitie And found how sonnes of men thereby did fall Him to this Knowledge did againe apply And swanlike sang Christs Churches Epithalamy Wake I or sleepe or am I in a trance Or doe another Salomon behold A Dauid who doth far and wide aduance His gracious scepter But no bounds can hold His Knowledge secret things for to vnfold Law History Arts and Philosophy All noble sciences that can be told Yet seemes to loue alone Diuinitie Which truely can direct in Peace to liue and die Who as hee is the Learnedest of Kings So tis his Ioy and Glory for to be The King of learned men which in all things Makes God to prosper him as all may see This makes him raise to place of high degree Men of great knowledge well to rule the Land And put downe Ignorance and subtiltie Which highest in their owne conceits doe stand Long sway thou Brittons Scepter with thy sacred hand And when thy Cloake Eliaslike must fall Vpon Elisha thine vndoubted heire Inherite hee thy Peace and Knowledge all And in thy Spirit rule as in thy chaire But I must leaue this field so ample faire Teach mee O Lord to know and doe thy will And let thy grace againe in me repaire Thine Image lost and all corruptions kill Thus we thy will on Earth as they in Heavn fulfill This knowledge must stand by vs at our last When as wee ready are our soules to tender To him that for false knowledge curious tast Though guiltlesse did his life to Iustice render For this the Holy Ghost doth more commend her That bare her Sauiours knowledge in her brest Than that shee bare him in her wombe yet tender For One all Generations call her blest By thother one of his true members shee doth rest But though this onely necessary is And first for our saluation to be sought Wee onely at our last of it haue misse As too meane subiect for ambitious thought Thus the vnlearned rise and heavn haue cought When greatest Clerks with Sciences profound Heartlesse and comfortlesse to Hell are brought For God doth their great wisedome oft confound Because their inward parts are not sincere and sound Alas of knowledge here we haue no care But all our youth in follies idely spend Our strength in lusts and strifes away we weare In age we worldly profit all intend Alas what gaine we by this at our end When our fraile Body doth returne to dust Our Soule to him that gaue it must ascend Whereof least iot of time account they must Which hath been spent in discord profit folly lust Oh knew we but the vertue of this treasure Like to the Merchant wise we would sell all To buy it where we should find profit pleasure Such Ioy as neuer on our hearts did fall Oh heavnly Comfort Ioy spirituall Delight vnspeakeable in hearts that grow Of those that shee is conuersant withall What Ioy can there be greater than to know Gods endlesse Loue in Christ which shee to vs doth show Sure I could wish my whole life here to spend In this diuine most holy contemplation whereof I know not how to make an end Shee yeelds such plentie of sweet meditation Most heavnly mysteries of our Creation Wherein appeare Gods might and Maiestie But aboue all his loue in mans saluation This is that wondrous hidden mystery Into the which eun Angels did desire to pry But we confesse though thou dost here reueale Abundant knowledge yet we little know Wherefore gainst vs the Heathen may appeale Who though thou didst to them but glimpses show Of Truth and Iustice did more righteous grow Than wee that doe thy sacred Truth confesse And make of Puritie a glorious show But to adorne the Gospel we professe With workes of Charitie Ah wee doe nothing lesse  page duplicate  page duplicate Oh it is meate and drinke we know not of To know and doe our heavnly Fathers will Our blessed Sauiour alwayes fed thereof And hereof Saints and Angells eate their fill These are the fruitfull plants which flourish still Milke Hony liuing Water spiced Wine Which doe refresh Christs Spouse when shee is ill These richest Iewells which her make so fine Locks Ribands Roses which so gloriously do shine For this shee is the Bridegroomes darling Doue And vnto her that bare her onely deare For this the daughters when they see her loue And all the Queenes and Wiues make merry cheere This makes her looke than Sunne and Moone more cleere Her nauell belly head necke brests adorne With these shee to her husband doth appeare More beautifull than is the fairest morne Or faire like twinning Ews on Gilead washt and shorne Thou that such heavnly Knowledge didst instill Into plaine Fishers that they could confound By argument evn Clerkes of greatest skill And diue into thy Mysteries profound Who by their clouenfiery tongues forth sound The Knowledge of thy Truth to evry Nation Canst make this Knowledge in mine heart abound By one sparke of diuine illumination And rauish my weake soule with heavnly admiration And though imperfect here our Knowledge be By reason of our humane imperfection And for by Faith alone we things doe see And nothing know indeed in true perfection Yet when thy Spirit cleares our minds infection Wee shall then know evn as we now are knowne And things now seene by mirrourlike inspection To vs shall be most euidently showne In Knowledge we shall reape what we in Faith haue sowne What thens imperfect shall be done away Knowledge shall perfect our felicitie Which is our free beholding God for ay In his great Goodnesse Loue and Maiestie So farre as finite may infinitie Farther to reach my Muse dares not be bold When Angels of so high sublimitie Gods Light and Maiestie cannot behold Finite with infinite can no proportion hold MEDITAT I Of ZEALE and godly IEALOVSIE OH that some holy fire enlightening My Soule now rauish would with thoughts diuine Whilst I of Iealousie Loues daughter sing And godly Zeale which like the Sunne doth shine Alas Minerua and the Muses nine Are too weake helpes their aide here to intreate With Colefrom Altar let some Seraphine Touch my rude tongue and set my braine on heate The Glory of this Grace in loftie rhimes to sweate Fit Subiect for a sacred Poets Verse Which should it selfe in Extasie transcend Zeales sacred Praise with Knowledge to rehearse Both Method and Deuotion doe commend Who as the houshold Chaplaine doth intend To all that liue in Royall Court of Loue And Prayers for them all to heaun doth send For without Zeale none possible can moue To high Olimpus Court the Seate of mightie Ioue For Prayers that to Heaun seeke to ascend Without the Feruour of this sacred Zeale Fall downe like smoakie vapours that intend Into Aires middle region to steale But those that are supported by her seale Like Fumes of incense by the Lamb contend Eun in thAlmighties presence to reueale Our wants and craue his aid vs to defend Gainst worlds and Serpents poyson to our latest end Oh thou to whom it was both drinke and meate To finish and to doe thy Fathers Will Whom Zeale of Gods owne house eun vp did eate And made thee on the Crosse thy bloud to spill Who whipst out Merchants that thy house did fill With doues and money theeues and merchandize Some Zealous iuice into my pen distill And raise my mind aboue her wonted guise That so my Muse may with her matter sympathise All other holy Graces disposition By rules of Art I formerly define But Zeale so feruent is no definition Can her containe or bound in any line Onely shee is by nature pure diuine Beloued daughter to the Queene of Loue Whose mothers Graces so in her doe shine Shee well the primate of her Court may proue And ranked be for place all other Peares aboue I here omit that Zeale which without hate Of others doth to vertuous deeds contend And vs enflames that good to emulate Which we to be in others apprehend I here that holy Iealousie commend Which onely doth from Loue diuine proceed When not for our but Gods cause we intend To loue both him and his in word and deed For this is that right Zeale which of true Loue doth breed Truth comes by knowledge and from zeale deuotions When therefore zeale doth with true knowledge meete Shee doth inlarge our hearts with heavnly notions Sublime transcendant admirable sweet But where this knowledge wants shees vndiscreet Rash violent seditious rude and blind Faults for so faire a Lady farre vnmeet You see two zeales here of a differing kind I leaue the worst and seeke the fairest out to find Sweet Lady daughter to the Queene of Loue Which is the cause of Zeale and Iealousie If you will aske mee what this Queene doth moue To loue vs wretches that in sin doe lye I answere Goodnesse of her Maiestie Most excellent is then this holy fire Of zeale proceeding from such ancestry Goodnesse and Loue which therefore wee require To true effects of Loue and Goodnesse to aspire Sweet zeale How fairely dost thou beautifie Thaffection where thou makst thy habitation Like Temple which thy Lord did purifie When as his Soule with zeale and indignation Was moud to see Gods Temples prophanation Not suffering thy house of endlesse rest To be abusd by Pride or lustfull passion Thaffection which doth lodge within my brest The Temple where Christ and the Holy Ghost should rest Companions of Zeale are Pietie Faith Knowledge Patience Fortitude and Right In workes of Mercy Peace and Charitie And sweet Humilitie is her delight With all her Power shee is opposite Against all that Gods glory may oppose Shee spends in feruent Prayers day and night And those by Knowledge doth so well compose They bring Gods blessings down and vp his Iudgements close Oh Zeale with Knowledge Faith and Charitie Who able is thy vertue to commend Which doth the Church into one Body tye And for Gods glory onely dost contend For publike good and not for priuate end Lo th AngellsBeing doth in zeale consist Whose sacred ardour doth all flames transcend Wherewith they oft enlight our minds darke mist When flames of hottest zeale they to our soule suggest Oh Loue as strong as Death and Iealousie Cruell as graue Thy flames like coales of fire Consume and burne vp all most violently No Streames or Flouds can quench her sacred ire Should we sell all we haue we could not buy her The Daughter zeale is like the Mother free Them both from Heaun th Almightie doth inspire And therefore neither will affronted bee With Riualls Heathen Gods most base Idolatree Fond Zeale thats fitly called which doth want Faith Knowledge Loue diuine and Graces all It still doth most vaine superstitions haunt And to most base Idolatry doth fall Vnhumane Fury Madnesse tragicall Of men whom thus blind zeale and strange desire Transports beyond rage diabolicall To offer vp their children in the fire Of some offended deuill to appease the ire Strange is this zealous fury of the rude When Ignorance doth guide their blind deuotion The gathering of the froward multitude When they be stirred with some feruent motion All following some brainesicke idle notion With discontent against authoritie Raise Schismes in Church in Commonwealth Commotion Pretending all their Conscienceliberty Alas these be no fruits of holy Iealousie God often by an Anthropopathy By which his nature best wee vnderstand Ascribes vnto himselfe this Iealousie As being linkd in Hymens holy band Vnto his Church his vndefiled And His Church againe to shew her feruent Loue And Ioy shee takes in her new ioyned hand Like Louesicke Bride the Bridegroome oft doth proue And him with zeale inuites her to imbrace and Loue Neuer new wedded Bridegroome was more faine Of his newBride than Christ is of his Doue Neuer did truest Turtle more complaine For losse of Mate than this Spouse of her Loue It would a stony heart to fountaines moue Of teares to heare the Churches piteous mone When shee doth misse him whom her Soule doth loue Wheres my beloud Ah whither is shee gone And left his saddest Deare to sigh and sit alone And therefore as a Signet on his heart And as the Seale that is on his right hand Shee would be ioynd that shee might neuer part But alwayes in his Grace and presence stand No Keeper in Christs Vineyard must command Hee will his Vineyard prune and dresse alone Whereby his Iealousie wee vnderstand His Vine the Bridegroome will haue drest of none The Bride out of his presence neuer will be gone Doth mine inuention faile that wont to flow In Similes that make hard things seeme plaine Or doth the whole Creation here below Nothing affoord zeales nature to explaine Alas all earthly Similes are vaine Texpresse the nature of this Heaunly fire Which in the glorious Angells doth remaine And in the Spirits of that blessed Quire Which here with Hymnes and Praises doe Gods loue admire Shall dust and ashes dare yet be so bold Her to the holy fire to compare Which in the Bush thy seruant did behold Flaming but did the Bush not singe or seare Such flames of zeale oft in our hearts there are Which doe enlighten them but not consume These flames our Prayers to Iehoua beare By these our Praises spiritually vp fume And in Gods nostrils are like incense and perfume Or shall I like her to some Lionesse Robd of her whelps by some aduenturous hand Who in her wondrous woe and furiousnesse Deuours and slayes all in her way that stand Who can the force of Iealousie withstand Being of so great strength and wondrous might God grant our zeale the Truth may vnderstand And that true Knowledge may your minds inlight To make vs zealous for Gods glory and the right May I not like her to strong churlish wine Which doth confound the braine inflame the blood But coold with water pure and sugar fine For both of them is soueraigne and good Eun so doth Iealousies most feruent mood Allaid with sugar of sweet Charitie And coold with sweetest Christalline pure floud The silent streames of soft Humilitie Transcend in all good workes of Loue and Pietic This is the zeale and sacred emulation Which the Originall doth signifie Which hath with Loue in Heaun her habitation And all our actions here doth sanctifie And when our Maker vs shall glorifie Behold our zeale shall in perfection shine Begun on earth in true sinceritie And as our Fleshly courage doth decline Our zeale will grow more hot and neerest to diuine Zeale made old Abram Hagars sonne reiect For scoffing at his holy promisd seed And Moses Pharaohs Court and grace neglect When hee th Egyptians Destiny did reed That smote a brother of the holy breed This zeale made noble Phineas with his speare Slay Zimry and Cosbi in their damned deed Though Saul the fat of Amalec would spare Yet Samuels zeale doth Agags flesh in pieces teare Oh had his Master Elis burnt so hot Against his sonnes when they by violence The fattest of Gods offrings from him got And with foule Lust defild the sacred Tents Had he like Phineas punisht this offence Our eares then should not haue so tingeled To heare of Gods great wrath and sore offence He and his sonnes in one day slaughtered And all his race from th Arke for euer banished Zeale made the warlike Dauid to aspire To build an house for Gods owne habitation And though warres crost his zeale and good desire Yet made he for it royall preparation Ands Sonne it finisht on his laid foundation Who gold and siluer vessels in did bring It making Iudahs Ioy the admiration Of all the World the Seat of the great King Whither the Tribes goe vp for his true worshipping I may with this example dignifie The noble zeale of our late famous Queene Who much desired to reedifie Paules Temples ruines which so fearefull seeme And make her faire as euer shee was seene But warres abroad and broiles within her Land Most fatall to this pious worke haue beene So as it still most ruinous doth stand Expecting helpe from Solomons pacificke hand Zeale like a Torch it owne selfe doth consume whilst burning it to others giueth light And like to sweetest incense and perfume For others Good spends all her force and might Oh blessed fire if kindled aright It burne with Loue of Heauen and holy things Retaining in our hearts both day and night His sweet imbraces who is King of Kings Loathing the worlds vaine wanton wicked dallyings This Cupid be thy soules and hearts delight Whose Bow and golden shafts of Zeale and Loue Doe conquer Furys Fates and worlds despight And stay the thunderbolts of angry Ioue Oh see the force of Loue and Zeale doth moue All powers that in Heaun Earth Hell transcend Grant thee alone I zealously may Loue And let thy Iealousie me safe defend That neuer to strange Gods I my affection bend Let vs learne zeale of him that in the days Ofs slesh did offer Prayers supplication With strongest crys and teares to God alwayes That able was to saue him from his Passion And learne of him true holy indignation To be evn eaten vp with feruent zeale To see theeues den in Gods owne habitation But first let Knowledge our Commission seale That where this Feruour wounds our Charitie may heale But ah our zeale of Prayer now growes cold Zeale of Gods glory like our Charitie And as the world declines now waxing old Evn so doth all our zeale and pietie We raise our houses evn to dare the skie But raze Gods Temples equall with the ground Our Fathers built them for posteritie And left with Ornaments adorned round But we them with their Ornaments seeke to confound As for the Temples of the Holy Ghost I meane our hearts the Bridegroomes habitation We will bestow on them no spirituall cost But leaue them foild with vilest prophanation Pride Lust Vaineglory all abomination Tis time to wish this holy Bishops zeale Would make of them to God new consecration And that the Holy Ghost their doores would seale Against all spirituall theeues that holy goods would steale Oh that some holy fit of Heaunly fire Raising my Muse to zealous contemplation Would in mine heart that feruent flame inspire And zealous Loue Saint Paul bare to his nation When as hee could haue wisht eun reprobation For their sakes from whose flesh Christ did descend Or of the Prophet by predestination Most sure his name in Booke of Life was pend Yet wisht it wiped out Gods glory to defend But I confesse we rather doe enuy Gods gifts and graces in our Bretheren And Iosuahlike forbid them prophesie Shewing more zeale to honour Greatnesse then To Glorifie the King of Heaun yea when We in our hearts find any emulation Tis for vaineglory and the praise of men To build our houses not Gods habitation And leaue faire large possessions to our generation Let vs with Dauid make a sacred vow And to thAlmightie God of Iacob sweare Neuer to come within our house nor bow Our Limbs vpon our Beds till we prepare A place Gods spirituall Temple vp to reare Nor euer suffer sleepe within our eyes Or slumber in our eyelids to appeare Till we an habitation doe deuise Where we may to thAlmightie offer sacrifice My mind inflame Lord with that hot desire And zeale to glorifie thy holy name That like thy Martyrs I may dread no fire Because I feele within a hotter flame Hot Coles therefore shall be to mee the same As to the Martyr was the Boiling Oyle Which did more coole indeed than him inflame Because his zeale within did hotter boile Sweet heaunly dewes doe most inrich the hottest soile Oh were mine head a conduit full of teares Mine eyes two rocks continually to run As well to cleanse foule Lusts of youthfull yeeres As coole the zealous slames in me begun Had I thus once my Bridegroomes presence won I neuer would let goe my welllaid hold Till hee into my Mothers chamber come With sweet embraces ay mee to infold His ardent Loue would neuer let my zeale grow cold MEDITAT III Of TEMPERANCE MY Muse now fares like to some Pilot wise Who hauing some dread stormes of danger past That tost his vessell oft vp to the skies Now sailing in the calme with temperate blast Goes gently on lest too much dangerous hast His ship vnwares on hidden rocke impight And him and all his hopes away should cast For thus it oft befalls some carelesse wight To wreck in fairest calme when they the storme haue quight I late was tost in rough and boisterous Sea Of Zeale and Iealousie which hauing past I am to saile in calme and fairest Lea Of Temperance most abstinent and chast Therefore my Muse goes on with sober hast Knowing against her many dangers lie Which by the touch tongue smell eye eare or taste Would her entrap and bring in ieopardy Which Poets by the Syrts and Syrens doe imply And therefore did the famous blind Bards quill Preferre Vlysses in his Court of Fame Who of this Temperance had got the skill Fore Aiax Hector or Achilles name His Odysses may testifie the same Which were composd his Temperance to commend By which he men and monsters ouercame And did life honour chastitie defend Gainst Syrens and Enchantments to his latest end And sure the Heathen to all Christians shame Seemd wondrously vs herein to transcend But that they wanted that most holy flame Of zeale which I so lately did commend And knowledge which should guide them to their end All that they had by natures light was showne But God his holy Word to vs doth send Whereby his Will and Counsell is made knowne What fruit then ought we beare where so good seed is sowne Eue was the first Author of Intemperance Led by her eye nice tast and fond desire Of Knowledge with proud wicked Ignorance And changd Gods Loue to euerlasting ire The Garden loosing for eternall fire But what shee lost his Temperance doth gaine Whose aid now in mine entrance I desire Who from all food did fortie dayes abstaine And alls Life from intemperate thought word deed refraine This Vertue some doe make so Cardinall That all the rest in her they would imply As Loue Peace Concord Pudour Virginall Gentlenesse Meekenesse Liberalitie Thrift Silence Friendship Goodnesse Grauitie Honesty Purenesse all true moderation Which doth withhold from Sin and Vanitie And bringeth vnto true humiliation Most happy Mother of so faire a Generation But in some limits that I may her bound I her define to be a moderation Of such desires as are within vs found In Diet Actions Words and Affectation For with these fowr I bound my Meditation In Diet shee requires Sobrietie In Actions true vnfaind humiliation Her Words she graceth aye with Modesty And her affections charmes with Meeknesse Chastity See in her Diet first Sobrietie In words and actions true humiliation Accompanyd with precious Modesty Last Continence from Lust and angry Passion The cause of all is prudent Moderation The aged Palmer Spencer Guyons trustie guide That stands against all stubborne perturbation By whose sage helpe secure and safe we slide By whirlepooles and deepe gulfes which gape for vs so wide For all through this worlds boistrous Sea must passe Before we at our quiet Havn arriue The Boate our Body is as brittle glasse Our Steeresman Temperance it right doth driue Besides the Rocks that threat this Boat to riue Are many Gulphes and Whirlepooles of decay Which wait th Affections and the Senses fiue By force and sweet Allurements to assay Some fall by rage and diet some by lustfull play But in that Body where doth reason sway And Sense and Passion be obedient There the affections all behold you may In happy peace and goodly gouernment There Temperance adornes her glorious Tent With vertues all to make it shine most bright The mirrour of Gods workes most excellent And to them all such bounteous banquets dight As may be best for Health Praise Profit and Delight Most glorious frame of nature which shee built The whole world in one point tepitomize Iust pure and perfect till intemprate guilt Her Makers Hests by Pride did foule misprise Since that shee learned to belowly wise And not obey intemperate desire Thus shee her glorious house reedifies And most of all doth lowly Cells admire The loftiest is no place for temperate retire Shee therefore neuer comes in company Of such as swim in pride and bathe in blisse Wasting their dayes in ease and luxury For in such ease men easily doe amisse But hee whose mind in studie watchfull is Whose limbs are toyld with labour mind with paine Shee these as her sweet darlings deare doth kisse The idle life cannot to her attaine Before her Gate high God employment did ordaine Excesse doth make the minde of beastly man Forget his first created excellence That pure estate in which his Life began And as a Beast that wants intelligence Twixt sense and reason put no difference But like a Brute of base and swinish kind Delights in filth and foule incontinence For Lust and Wine so far transforme the minde Affections beare the sway and royall reason binde Thus Bacchus Fountains turnd to puddle lake Wherein like filthy beasts base men lie drownd And Swines of Gods faire Images doe make This vice hath now with vs such footing found As Drunkennesse with glory doth abound Pure Liber wont to be the Muses friend All musing Wit and Learning doth confound The Flemings this did first to vs commend But herein we them and all Nations now transcend No better stratageme doth Satan know I alwayes must except base drunkennesse Then gaming all our youth to ouerthrow The fruict Intemperate of Idlenesse Oh horrible infernall wickednesse To heare a wretch his Makers name blaspheme When Dice or Carding crosse his good successe And eun his Soule which Christs bloud did redeeme With his estate to hazard to a dyes esteeme Intemprate drinking Play smoake in excesse Is now our gallants onely occupation The poisoning fruits of their loose Idlenesse Base Gourmandizing filthy Fornication Is turnd from foule reproach to commendation Now vse of Armes and manly exercise Are held a toile and not a recreation Who so is moderate chast valiant wise Him as precise and cynicall they doe despise Oh foolish Man learne Temperance of thy Dog Thine Horse and Hawke wherein thou takst delight Which when they should shew sport thou dost not clog And fill with food their greedie appetite Thou them dost diet that they may be light And keepst from Lust their courage to prolong One dulls the Body thother kills the Sprite But Abstinence doth make both swift and strong The temperate mans dayes are happy healthfull long And may vnto Pauls Pilote be compard Whose vessell with exceeding tempest tost Vnlades and lightens hauing most regard To saue his Life though all his goods be lost Eun so the temperate man in this world crost With baits of appetite lust anger pride Makes vse of those that for his vse are most But needlesse things wherewith his vessels cloid With his owne hands doth to the hungry fish diuide When I behold the stately Firmament Adornd with glorious Lamps of heaunly fire The Stars with their appointed roomes content And neither other to supplant desire Their Temperance in Heaun I doe admire But then I view the anbitious sparkes below Who to possesse the whole Earth doe aspire And all poore Cottages to ouerthrow That stopt their prospect great alone on earth to grow Nature with small no plentie Lust can bound Vnlimited desires here satisfie No Gold nor Siluer can though they abound Like stones amongst the wise Kings vanitie Though Iesses Sonne haue such varietie Of Wiues and Maids yet comes the stranger Lust Vrias onely Lamb for him must dye No homebred fare can satisfie base dust But strange rare cates from forraine nations haue we must The temprate man I to a Brooke compare Contented with sweet Fountaines of her owne Which runs most pleasant pure delightfull cleere But if with flouds her channels once be flowne Then streight her troubled waters foule are growne So whilst we Temperance with vs retaine And no excesse of Diets in vs knowne Our heart from ire our bed is free from staine But cease from Temperance and all is foule againe And as pure Streames continue sweet and cleere Whilst they within their Channells swiftly flow Refreshing all the plants and flowers neere But if they idlely stand or run but slow Then thicke and foule like idle lake they grow Evn so the man that doth his minde aduance His Makers heaunly will to doe and know To honour shall be raisd aboue all chance But he that idle grows falls to Intemperance Shee is a short but a most pleasant way Wherein small labour is but much delight The Empresse that doth our affections sway The Genus of all other vertues hight Piller of Fortitude The Helmet bright Against Lasciuiousnesse The eyes best guide Bond of goodwill of cogitations light Restraint The Enemy of Lust and Pride The Soules chast counsellour her vow and prayers to guide Of Prudence and true Wisdome the foundation To him that hath her can no ill befall No greater wealth can be then Contentation Who hath her hath that who lacks that wants all Who nothing need eun Gods the Heathen call Fortune may bring vs wealth and royall fare But Temperance must giue content withall By her we freed from perturbations are And hauing daily bread doe take no farther care For from her Temper shee receiues her name As being of extreames the moderation The golden meane that doth affections frame Actions and Words to natures ordination Vnspotted pure as at our first Creation Thus wee abstaine from Lust and Violence And though on earth is yet our Conuersation Wee hope ere long to be receiued hence Meane while our Lifes a sacrifice of Continence Thus see our protoplasts first clothd in skins The greene herbe of the field their onely meate The Beasts their Conuiues and the Woods their Inns To shield from cold and saue from scorching heate And all this must be got with toile and sweate No liuing thing was then allowed good For as the learned thinke man might not eate Of any liuing creature till the Floud But since as the greene herbe God gaue them all for food How often did the Fathers pray and fast And some from women some from wine abstaine Till sixtie yeeres they keepe their bodies chast A Temprate and chast seed here to obtaine When Ruth at Booz feet all night had laine He ladeth her with corne and sends away From lawlesse Lust he doth himselfe containe Though he had dranke and cheerd his heart that day An habite of true Temperance see here you may Ioseph would not against his Maker sinne For Pharoahs Stewards Ladies soft embrace Yet easier tis a walled towne to winne Than to resist temptations vile and base Nought sooner doth our liues with Lust disgrace Than bathe in ease and swim in foule excesse Had Dauid beene at warre in Ioabs place He had not falne into such wickednesse Adultery the fruit of fulnesse Idlenesse Oh tell me Dauid where was then become Thy fasting wont thy soule to humble so That it was wont to thy reproach to come And weakned so thy knees thou couldst not goe Thy teares which did to such great plentie grow They were thy meat and drinke both day and night All watering thy couch so they did slow That eun my Muse weepes at thy piteous plight Yet had thy soule therein vnspeakeable delight I cannot but admire the Temperance Of that great Monarch mightie Phillips Sonne Who when he had vnto his gouernance Darius Empire Wife and Daughters wonne Their beautie would by no meanes looke vpon Esteeming it a most vnworthy deed When he so many men had ouercome To be of one weake woman conquered Like Temperance of so yong a Prince I neuer read Not that the Heathens Temper I compare To those that haue beene truely sanctifide Of which Iob is to vs a patterne rare Who least his eyes should draw his heart aside Did couenant they on no Maid should glide How infinite are watchings fastings cold Which to subdue the flesh Paul did abide But aboue all thexamples I haue told The Locusteater ands Disciples liues behold And though whilst that the Bridegroome pleasd to stay The children of Bridechamber did not fast Yet when from them he taken was away Behold they then did pay for all was past And oft did hunger whip and prison tast No Poets quill ere able was to faine Like Temprance of pure Lamb most temprate chast Reuiled scoffed scorned scourged slaine Yet opnd not his mouth to scoffe or speake againe Oh shall the King of Angels and of Men Abusd by workmanship of his owne hand Endure such wrongs and neuer turne agen Whose one word could haue calld thwhole heaunly Band The Fury of these wretches to withstand And shall the Lord of Life so meekly dye For our intemperate affections and Shall not we them all with him crucifie And fleshly members of our Bodys mortifie But we like Foxes build a stately hall And like the Birds in stately cedars nest When Hee that did of nothing make them all Had not a place to lay his head to rest Wee see his glorious members here distrest Want lodging food and raiment for the cold Whilst we abound in meates and fill our chest With change of raiment and with store of gold And in birds softest plumes our looser limbs infold Alas how many hunting worlds gay showes By base Intemperances sweetned baite And vile Ambition which downe headlong throwes Are brought to ruine most infortunate Oh grant that I may liue in meane estate And my freed soule with Contemplation please My clothing warme my diet temperate Freed from all tempests of worlds raging seas Which tosse poore sailing soules in dangerous disease Most happy who with little is content That though he want yet neuer doth complaine Ne wisheth more his sorrow to augment Knowing that he by heaping wealth doth gaine Nothing but care vexation and paine What more than daily bread here doe I need What need of forraine cates or feathers vaine Let fields my food my flocke my clothing breed No other would I weare no other would I feed In vaine doe foolish men the Heauns accuse Of sad misfortunes paines and iniuries Which doe if we knew truely them to vse To eury man whats fittest for him size Thats not the best estate which most we prize Nor that the worst which most men seeke to shun Each as he list his fortunes may deuise Which wishes no man happinesse hath wun Such wishers cease to liue before their life begun  page duplicate  page duplicate  page duplicate  page duplicate It is mans mind that maketh good or ill Wretched or happy sad glad rich or poore He hath abundantly all things at will That hauing little yet desires no more When he thats drownd in wealth swims in store Doth liue in want to satisfie desire Which neuer hath enough fond fooles therefore Are they that feed Lusts and Ambitions fire Which like base Auarice doth more and more require When first I saw the glory of the Great I then them onely happy men did hold For sumptuous houses lodging rayment meat Honour Attendance Iewells Siluer Gold But when the cares and dangers I behold Of those whom Fortune doth so high aduance How to dissembling slattery some are sold Lust Fulnesse Idlenesse Intemperance My life I happy deeme in quiet lowly chance Thus of late follys I though late complaine And that sweet Peace which doth not there appeare Now in mine homely Cell I entertaine Which by her want I learne to loue more deare Sweet holy quiet life where meanest cheare To hungry stomocks is a daily feast Where thirst like Nectar makes fresh cooling beere Where in a cabbin is more quiet rest Than on Downe Persian beds with Gold and Feathers drest In this estate I no man doe enuie Nor would enuied be of any one Great store of wealth doth store of cares supply That little that I haue is still mine owne I reape with Ioy the crop that I haue sowne Without least care but onely to attend it The Lambs I weane are daily greater growne What haue I but to praise him that doth send it And with a cheerefull heart vnto the poore to lend it But least corrupt my mind or body grow with too much ease or wanton Idlenesse My mind I set my Makers Will to know His Wisedome Power Truth and Holinesse I often ride or walke to wearinesse The members of my body to subdue And Temper gainst Lust and Laciuiousnesse Thus by sweet contemplation oft I view Such high transcendent things as yet I neuer knew Thus rapt with contemplation I find That all these worldsgay shows which men admire Are but vaine shadows to the ioys of mind Of those that lead their liues in safe retire Whose onely happinesse and hearts desire Is here the talents God hath lent to spend Vnto his glory as he doth require And vsing Temperately what he doth send Thus grant that I may liue Thus grant that I may end MEDITAT IIII of BOVNTIE NOw will I raise faire Almas stately tower On Temperance her strong and soundest frame And goodly deck Dame Bountys dainty bower Whereby all Princes gaine immortall fame Some call her Alma some her Bounty name The trusty Almner of Loues Royall Court Who beares the bag to giue to blind and lame And Suitors all that thither doe resort Rewards most bounteously and feeds in seemely sort For on this heaunly Dame the eyes of all Looke vp that of her liberalitie They may receiue and shee againe lets fall Vpon them needfull things most plenteously Her bounteous hand shee opens willingly With blessings eury creature full to fill To those that Knowledge seeke abundantly Shee giueth Wisdome Vnderstanding Skill To know their Makers Bountie Maiestie and Will Most glorious Alma when as Temperance Controlls the noble Plentie of her Hall And with her Staffe keepes out Intemperance Which doth abuse her Grace and Bountie all For where most Plentie is there most doe fall By want of Temperance to Lust and Sin Till they be brought low as the Prodigall For he that will true Praise by Bountie win Must first of all at home with Temperance begin For Temperance with watchfull diligence Are like two springs which waters doe supply To open handed free Beneficence And her discernes from Prodigalitie By Diligence we get sufficiencie By Temperance what we haue gotten spare To minister to Liberalitie For these two LadyBountys handmaids are And for her iust and truly store of wealth prepare But they that liue in sloth and foule excesse Though they may seeme to be most liberall Oppression and Extortion mercilesse Are Lakes from whence their Bountys streamed doe fall And thus they rob the poore that therewithall They may themselues rich friends and children feast Blaspheming their great Maker Lord of all And imitating basest sauage beast Which fawnes vpon the great But doth deuoure the least God of all Bountie King most Liberall Who to thy vassall Man at his Creation Didst subiect make Fish Fowle Beasts creatures all And of thine handy works gaust domination Who by thy prouidence and ordination Him needfull things not onely dost prouide But for his health delight and contentation That he may plentie to the poore diuide My Muse to sing heart hands to practise Bountie guide Bountie Beneficence Benignitie In name though diuers one in substance be Beneuolence and Liberalitie Make actions and affections agree If as they are in God you wish to see They like his Goodnesse are vnlimitted And as his Mercy Loue and Grace are free Which on his creatures are abundant shed But by my shallow Muse their depth cannot be read They are too high to reach too deepe to sound For all the earth is filled therewithall In heaun aboue Gods Goodnesse doth abound The Bountie of his Grace is ouer all Of all the Meditations which call My mind to holy Ioy and admiration None lets more comfort than Gods Bountie fall Both for my being and my preseruation But most in that he shed his bloud for my Saluation Here could I wish my Muse might euer dwell In viewing Gods great Goodnesse Bountie Loue Which three to thholy Trinitie I well May here ascribe For Goodnesse first doth moue The Father to beget Eternall Loue From Loue and Goodnesse Bountie doth proceed Yet all these three as one in God doe proue In substance one although distinguished In working But this height my reach doth far exceed And therefore rauisht now with contemplation Beyond the compasse of my feeble eye My soule amazd falls downe to adoration Of this misterious holy Trinitie And from diuine come to benignitie And bountie which should be in men below A habit wee of liberalitie Her call and good affection we should show In thought heart word and deed to eury one we know And must from goodnesse and true loue proceed The onely cause of true benignitie Wherefore except these be in vs indeed Our bounty is but prodigalitie Or some like froth of superfluitie The crums and leauings of Intemperance Which oft are dealt out with an euill eye More for vaine credit or base circumstance Then for goodwill or care Gods glory to aduance For eury act hath then her true effect Which from true ground right aymeth at her end As when both loue and goodnesse doth direct What bounty truly gets aright to spend Loe thus doth heaunly grace and Bounty send Her blessings temporall alike to all But doth for greater benefits intend To those that on Gods name aright doe call And in this heaunly sort ought we be liberall Oh then th effects of bounty glorious are When Prouidence with true Frugality Doe seeke by Iustice to prouide and spare Fit sustenance for liberality Behold that heaunly bounteous Maiesty Sends raine and fruitfull seasons whereby store Of Blessings thearth may to his hand supply And many hidden treasures vp doth store For to exalt the rich and to refresh the pore Then humane bounty like her Makers is When as shee labours to doe good to all But most of all to bring poore soules to blisse And fill their hearts with food spirituall Oh Grace Diuine Bounty Angelicall With spirituall loaues in Wildernesse to feed Gods Saints when spirituall hunger them doth gal The ignorant which pine with inward need Diuine sweet comforts to their fainting soules to reade True Bountys knowne best by her company For shee in Truth and Mercy takes delight Faith Iustice Temperance Humility And is withall Loues graces richly dight Herein appeares her glorious heaunly Sprite Shewing that shee of seed diuine is borne Of Loue and Goodnesse not of Vaine delight Or Fame and Praise of men when shee doth scorne To seeke feignd bounteous shewes her goodnes to adorn For thus th ambitious man is bountifull Thus bellygods in plentie take delight Deceit with gifts his neighbour seekes to gull The couetous bribe large to conquer right From such false Bounty Truth is banisht quite Humility Faith Knowledge Temperance Nor any of Loues Graces in her sight May suffered be their ensignes to aduance There dwells Contention Pride Oppression Ignorance As daughters of the horseleech still doe cry Giue giue as Graue and Hell be neuer full So nought the couetous eye can satisfie But he thats liberall and bountifull Is like full clouds which doe most plentifull Water the earth and poure downe store of raine Yet are not emptie for the mercifull And liberall shall greater plentie gaine And he that scattereth shall find increase againe That hand is neuer emptie of reward Where as goodwill the hearts chest filleth full And bountie neuer is so much afeard Causlesse to giue As not be bountifull Where need requires His face is beautifull Where sweet Goodwill both heart and lookes haue Ioynd But thenuious and malitious doe pull On wrinkles And a man shall euer find The beautie of the face to alter with the mind Bountie is like vnto the glorious Sun Which as a Bridegroome doth from chamber glide And as a Gyant ioys his course to run From East to West most swiftly he doth ride Nothing froms fertile heat it selfe can hide He doth not looke that one him vp should call So bountie deales her Graces far and wide And Blessings without asking sends to all Expecting not vaine praise where shee lets graces fall As some faire glorious garment which we weare Vpon our shoulders reaching to the ground Couers all spots and Naeues that on vs are So where this noble bounty doth abound It couereth all faults that can be found For as Loue couers so doth Bounty hide A multitude of sins and doth confound By her bright Beames Detraction Enuy Pride Alas these are to weake where Bountys on our side Shees like vnto the Lamp of glorious day Which doth diuide the darknesse from the light For whereas Bountie doth her beames display Behold bright day without them there is night The King that by his bountie doth inuite His subiects hearts to Loue and Honour due Sleepes more secure than he that doth by might And feare strong forts and walled townes subdue And for his guards encompassed with armed crue Bountie and Benefits are eun the Bands Of Concord and as fire doth quickly dye That is not fostered with coles or brands So dies true Loue with men Except supply Be made by gifts and liberalitie Who doth the wandring soule direct aright Though with him he doth deale most bounteously Yet doth he but his fellowes candle light And to another giues yet loseth selfe no light True bounty seekes high God to imitate Who to the most vnthankfull is most free Sol doth his light to Theeues participate And without tempests Pirates saile on Sea The Heauns of all good things the Authors bee Faire fortunes to vngratefull fooles doe send As onely seeking to doe good so we Though oft in vaine our bountie we doe spend To the vnthankfull must as to the thankfull lend Gods bountys like to incense and perfume Cast on an heart inflamd with holy zeale Which praises vp like cloudes of smoake doth sume And sweetest odours round about doth deale Mans Bounty is like widowes cruse or meale Which spent vpon the Prophet growes to more Like Surgeons skill which as he more doth heale Doth grow more cunning than he was before The diligent and bounteous hand want neuer store As many fruits doe faire encrease and grow Not so much by the nature of the ground As by the bounty which from Heaun doth flow And temperate aire that is about them found So all good Arts in noblest wits abound More by some Princes liberalitie And high regard they haue of Muses sound Than their owne nature strength and industry Best friends to Arts are Bounty and Humanity Should I but here recount the names of all Whom bountifull in holy Writ I find I of your patience should be prodigall And my short time for this discourse assignd Let me their names vp in a bundle bind Which if you please to ope as sweetly smell As Camphires bush my Muse is now inclind Of some prophane examples here to tell Which seeme in noble Bounty others to excell Than treasure Cyrus more his friends esteemd Whereof he multitudes by bounty won And Alexander greatest glory deemd By bounty neuer to be ouercome A King of Egypt thought it better done His subiects coffers than his owne to fill When as Alphonsus heard Titus Vespasians sonne Accounted that day lost when for goodwill He had giun nought said I nere spent a day so ill Behold these fiue examples liue in one The bounteous Monarch that our Scepter sways Esteemes his friends boue gold or precious stone And ouercomes eun all that him obays By soueraigne Bounty tos immortall praise No King so fills his subiects chests with gold His bounteous deeds in number passe his days Ah how then dare my niggard rimes be bold The sacred bounty of my Soueraigne to vnfold Who hoards not vp his wealth in Caue or Tower Nor into prisons darke condemnes his gold But as on him from heaun all Blessings shower So are his to vs Subiects manifold As from thicke clouds we numberlesse behold Large streames of fruitfull raine on earth to fall So is his largesse to his seruants told Who entring poore returne rich from his hall Like Tagus golden sands his hands are liberall Vouchsafe oh bounteous Soueraigne heare thy thrall After thy cloud a subiects dropd to sing Whom thou didst to deserued honour call And was in name and bountie as a King Who in thy bounteous steps thee following Did from obscurity my Fortunes raise Without desert or my least offering He now in Heaun his bounteous King doth praise As he with bounty honourd him here all his days And let vs all his bounteous praises sing Whose bounty vs from Hell and Death doth raise Our blessed Sauiour Prophet Priest and King Who here in bounteous deeds spent all his days Casting out Deuills sauing soules always Healing the sicke giuing the blind their sight Mournes for our sins for enemies he prays Comforts the rich and feeds the hungry wight And still in doing good doth set his whole delight How could malicious heart of enuious man Consent to murther such a bounteous King Scourge scorne deride despight him what they can Still in his bounteous deeds perseuering Yea when vnto the Crosse they him doe bring Father they know not what they doe he crys And when his body hangs their torturing He to the Thiefe not Paradise denyes Thus doing good he liues Thus doing good he dyes What doth the Lord of Life eternall dye Which vnto vs eternall life doth giue See his large bounty and benignity Hee gaue his life for vs that we might liue What heart of stone doth not here melt or riue But with his Life his Bounty doth not end He by his Will and Testament doth giue Vs Heaun yea more the Comforter doth send With millions of Angells on vs to attend Who can of this his Sauiours Bountie tast And to his members not be bountifull If thou want wealth and coine giue what thou hast And let our hearts be alwaies mercifull And like the fertile ground yeeld plentifull Encrease of all the seeds which thereon grow Tis Bountie that doth fill our garners full He sparing reapes that sparingly doth sowe True Bountys noble hand no want did euer know But ah too many couetous of Praise And Glory doe by fraud and rapine spoile Others that they thereby there names may raise And some goods gotten by much care and toile Spend on their pleasures and thereby beguile Their poore and needy neighbour of his right Drinking and surfetting in ease the while And spending frankly on some base delight Like Brutes are bountifull to their owne appetite Some onely by their Bountie seeke for fame And these are onely to Ambition free Some Patrons now adays such Shepheards name To feed the Flocke as loose and Idle Bee Wealth vnto wealth to adde they all agree Mo man respects the needy and the poore The emptie vessels emptie still we see They that are full to them is added more Dry hills want water when the valleys swim with store As Knights which of the noble Order are Of Garter that they better may be knowne A golden George about their necke they weare Nor doe the same at any time lay downe Whereby their noblenesse should be vnknowne So Nobles alwaies weare Benignitie Whereby whose Sonnes you are yee may be showne For nothing proues you Sonnes of the most High More than your Bountie and true Liberalitie But of salse bountie you doe vainely boast Delighting in vaine pastime oyle and Wine And gluttons feed for glory to your cost Whilst at your doores the poore may sterue and pine You welcome such as you inuite to dine But scarce afford the poore scraps at your gate Which shew that all your bountie is to Ioyne Credit and Glory to your great estate And but for Crowes and Kites or Daws do lay a Baite You for a million at a cast will play And hazard all your fortunes at a game And grudge not for one daintie bit to pay A thousand and then glory in the same With gold you tricke and trim vp some loose Dame The sinke that sucks vp all your Liberalitie Thus lauish you to your eternall shame All that your Fathers got by their Frugalitie And left to you to spend in bounteous hospitalitie Braue Alexanders deeds for ay commends His wondrous confidence and bountie rare Who dealing out amongst his faithfull friends Lands houses townes he gold and all did share When one besought him wisely to forbeare For what said he alas is left the King New hopes of gaming more said he there are Thus on his fate and fortunes venturing The Heauns propitious seemd to him in eury thing But ah poore Prince thy hopes are all but vaine As were the Benefits thou didst expose But we are certaine of eternall gaine If bounteously Gods blessings we dispose Ah what is it if worldly things we loose And thereby gaine vs an Eternall Crowne Which heaunly Bountie layeth vp for those That their owne glory willingly lay downe And what they reape by Bountie bounteously haue sowne Such all within most gloriously shall shine Their vestiments shall be of twined Gold They shall of Hony tast and spiced Wine And all the Bridegroomes fruits both new and old He gently will such in his armes infold And satisfie their sense with pleasing smell No eare hath heard no tongue hath euer told The Ioy and Bounty that with him doe dwell But more of these where next of heaunly Ioy I tell MEDITAT V Of Spirituall and Heaunly IOY HOw should a heart opprest with worldly cares Of Spirituall inward Ioy now rightly sing Since none her knowes but who her image beares And feeles the Spirits inward witnessing All sacred stuffe I to this building bring No helpe but he that Abba Father crys Can teach my Muse to touch this golden string I therefore here forbeare prophane supplys My Spirit wholly on the holy Spirit relys Well said the King All worldly things are vaine And trauell which beneath the Sun he found Compared to left drop or minutes gaine Which Spirituall Ioy did to his heart propound No reach of Wisards skill no wit profound Is able this true Ioy to comprehend This Musicke wholly to the Saints doth sound The inward man can onely apprehend Sweet liuely Spirituall Ioy which neuer shall haue end No Muses darling euer yet did dreame Of this sweet wind which where it lists doth blow This onely is sweet Israels Singers theame Which he by heaunly influence did show And then most when the outward man brought low By paine of body or by griefe of mind Did from his pen diuinest comforts flow Most heaunly Ioys which he was wont to find To grow more strong within as he without declind Oh Ioy of ioys vnspeakeable delight Eun when our soules the powers of hell doe shake And vs with Iustice and due vengeance fright When as our guilty conscience is awake That all with terrour tremble horrour quake That then our gentle beame of heaunly Grace Not onely shall from vs this horrour take But in Loues armes vs in an instant place They onely know this Ioy that haue beene in this case If euer I receiued strength and skill From Heaun to scale the hill of contemplation I now doe hope Gods gracious Spirit will Me fill with Ioy for his sweet meditation Oh blessed Spirit who by sweet inspiration Directest eury holy Prophets quill Enlighten mine by heauns illumination That most diuine sweet Ioys it may distill Into the Readers heart and Mine with comfort fill No tongue could euer tell no heart conceiue Therefore no Art is able to define What is the inward Ioy which we receiue By peace of conscience and Grace diuine But sure it is that speciall marke or signe Which on our soules the holy Spirit of Grace Most gently doth imprint and liuely line Whereby we doe behold Gods cheerefull face And spiritually feele our Bridegroomes sweet embrace There is a naturall and carnall Ioy Besides this inward Ioy spirituall By one we common blessings here enioy By thother we in Sin and errour fall Those be partakers of Ioy naturall That health of body haue and worldly store The carnall Ioy we sinfull pleasures call Excesse of meate and wine Lips of a whore And all mans vaine delights gainst rule of heaun lore These Ioys which with false pleasures vs deceiue Are not of kin to Ioy spirituall For that they always doe our hearts bereaue Of inward Ioyes pure food Angelicall Gods goodnesse is thefficient cause of all And though each person in the Trinitie May seeme to haue a working seuerall Yet all in one and one in all agree With Ioy here to begin mans true felicitee There many causes are materiall Why we this inward Ioy in vs should haue Gods freest grace which doth most surely call All those that he elected hath to saue The Peace of conscience which Ioy vs gaue And eke the Ioy of our Sanctification Whereby eun heauens inheritance we craue And certainly expect glorification And are inuited guests to heauns participation As are Gods gifts and graces infinite So causes are of Ioy spirituall It fills my soule with infinite delight When all his benefits to mind I call But none like this thats Sonne should saue vs all By that great secret of his Incarnation Which made the Babe into Ioys passion fall At blessed Mothers heaunly Salutation And made blind Simeons soule reioyce in his Saluation This made the Mother of the Babe to sing And her sweet little Lord to magnifie Her Sauiour which shee in her armes did bring This made in heaunly Host such melody When newes was brought of his Natiuity Oh Ioy of Ioys to you is borne this day A Sauiour God from all eternitie This made the Wisemen from the East to stray And offer to him gifts that in a cradle lay This made the holy King propheticall Though many pleasant Lays to Harpe hee sing Straine none so high and so patheticall As those of his Sonne Sauiour Lord and King Oh then each stroake hee strikes to heaun doth ring His heart reioyceth and his tongue is glad Such Ioy doth hope of resurrection bring That though his flesh be with corruption clad His heart shall neuer faint nor soule be euer sad We for this hope it count exceeding Ioy When we doe fall on many sore temptations And when afflictions most abound we Ioy In Trialls Sufferings and Tribulations The Angells in their holy habitations At our conuersions wondrous Ioy receiue What passing Ioy will be and delectations When all the members to their head shall cleaue And for short Sorrowes endlesse recompence receiue My Muse her selfe eun out of breath now flys Raisd vp so high by Ioy Spirituall Yet by Ioys obiects she must higher rise To Father Sonne the Holy Ghost and all What greater Ioy than on the Father call And how did Abraham reioyce to see The day of his Redeemers nuptiall Ah what more Ioy vnspeakeable can bee Than feele the holy Spirit of Grace to dwell in thee Oh happy Host such guests to entertaine With peace of conscience their continuall feast Open you euerlasting doores againe Open The King stands knocking ready prest The King of Glory to come in and rest Downe from the figtree speedily then come And

Graces bide Longsuffering Mercy Peace desire to Pray God these hath ioynd no man may them diuide False Ioys without these into vs may slide As stony ground which did receiue the seed Did flourish faire and Branch on eury side But this did Faith but temporary breed And we this but a momentany Ioy areed There are besides this friendly seeming Ioy Other that are professed enemys As those which worldly happinesse enioy And liue in pleasures ease and jollitys Against these thauthor of true ioy replys Woe vnto you that laugh for you shall waile Lament and howle for your iniquitys When Iudgement comes and all mens hearts shal faile What then shall all your worldly pleasures you auaile Another Ioy against true Ioy I find When in true cause of Ioy we so delight That we omit from Lusts to clense our mind And valiantly gainst base affections fight Ah how can heaunly true Ioy take delight Amongst our grosse corruptions here to dwell Sure this Reioycing is not good and right A little Leuen makes the whole lump smell Our boastings vaine This waters not from liuing well There is a counterfett and feignd delight Shewd in the face but comes not from the heart Whom I may call A merry Hypocrite Others reioyce so in their owne desert In their redemption they will beare a part These are the men whom workes must iustifie Alas poore wretch remember what thou art And whence thou hast receiued thy supply And thou shalt soone from this thy proud reioycing slye Proud slesh and bloud that dares of merits boast When in thy Makers presence thou dost stand And hopest to regaine what Adam lost By thine inherent Iustice thou dost band Directly gainst thy Makers glory and Seekst to reioyce in Iustice of thine owne Presume not boue thy strength to vnderstand But merry be and glad in God alone Who is all Worthinesse but in thy selfe is none As those which vaine applause of men regard And at their doing almes a trumpet blow Gaine onely praise of men for their reward But God no such goodworkes will euer know So those in whom these boasting merits flow And in their meritorious workes delight God neuer them doth this sound comfort show They may awhile seeme goodly in mans sight But neuer feele true inward Ioy and sound delight As those which onely see the Stars and Moone But neuer saw faire Phaebus glorious light Beleeue no cleerer lights haue euer shone Than those faire Lamps which doe adorne the night So those that neuer knew this true delight Those heaunly Ioys to holy Saints confind Thinke there most Ioy where flesh doth most delight But tast they once sweet inward Ioy of mind In all these worldly Ioys they no content can find This heaunly Ioy by no similitude In Heaun or Earth can truly be exprest Yet is shee felt as oft in simple rude As in the most profound deepe learned breast None know her till they be of her possest For as we feele the winde when it doth blow But whence it comes or where it meanes to rest No wit of man ere able was to show So many feele these Ioys but know not whence they flow As in the Incarnations mysteries The blessed Virgin ouershadowed By th Holy Ghost and power of the most High Perceiud her fruitfull womb replenished But knew not whence till th Angell it aread So wee this Babe of Ioy spirituall Oft feele in vs most liuely quickened But know not how nor whence the same doth fall Till that same Spirit of Truth to vs reuealeth all And as no creature able is of man The Spirit to discerne but man alone So of this Spirituall Ioy no spirit can Conclude but this sweet spirituall holy One Some would it liken to the glorious Sunne Which by his liuely beames doth Life inspire Where they an obiect fit to light vpon But I forbeare too nicely to inquire And rather in mine heart to feele her beames desire Oh Sunne of Light Bright Glory of thy Sire Who when thou leftst the earth thy Spirit didst send Into our hearts sweet comforts to inspire And with vs to abide till worlds last end Some good examples to my Muse commend Of holy men which tooke so much delight In heaunly Ioys they holy them intend And banish all vaine worldly pleasures quite Shining like glorious Lamps in worlds obscurest night This inward heate this holy heaunly fire Most what concealed vnder ashes lys Which one till into flames they doe respire At home more easie than aborad descrys Because it selfe within best testifys In Abraham appeard this holy flame When as he saw his Sauiour with his eyes Who of his blessed seed long after came For Abram saw Christs day and ioyed in the same Vp Miriam vp thou merily canst sing Now through

and her sluggish sprite Shee will not rise to let thee in before Thou thence art gone And then thy losse shee doth deplore These are the apples odours nuts and wine Which comfort her when shee is

BRIDES ORNAMENTS MEDITAT I Of WISDOME and PRVDENCE THE first degree to Wisdome is the misse Of Folly For as Darknesse the priuation Is of Lights Being But no Being is So Folly is of wise illumination And as in Chaos rude at first Creation There was all Darknesse by the want of Light So in all men before their renouation Are Follys mists and errours blackest night Till there the Spirit moue which all things doth inlight The Poets which did wondrously transcend In making Mysterys by Fictions plaine All other Graces as diuine commend But Wisdome they to be a Goddesse faine Minerva who proceedeth from the braine Of Iupiter whom they the Mistris hight Of all the Graces and the Muses traine To whom shee oft descends for her delight Wearyd with toile of Gouernment and Martiall fight Thus her of Warre Peace Politie and Arts They Goddesse make as if they should her call The Wisdome God the Father thus imparts Vnto the Sonne to make rule order all With God the Father Coessentiall As all his Attributes Power Truth and Loue For on the Persons Consubstantiall No accident can fall or thence remoue This Soules faint eye conceiues of Wisdome from aboue Which is vnto my minds obscured eye As to my Bodys Sunne in Firmament The farther off the easier to descry For neerenesse breedeth but astonishment Oh glorious Wisdome Sun most orient Into my soule with Folly clouded shine Some clearer beames of wisdome excellent The whilst I sing these radiant rayes of thine Which make a mortall wight seeme gloriously diuine What and how great is wisdomes heaunly skill No heart of man is able to conceiue Much lesse expresse by any tongue or quill For none but Wisdome wisdome can perceiue The cause vnknowne of nothing shee doth leaue A Numen of such wondrous excellence Shee doth no good but from her selfe receiue Being her owne end ayme and recompence No good in Heaun or Earth but flows from Sapience And therefore calld the proper Good of Ioue Which though to Men and Angells hee dispence In wise proportion yet from him doth moue All wisdome and to him hath reference For as in Power so in Sapience He doth all other heaunly Powers transcend For Wisdome Ground is of Omnipotence And as we Mortalls on her hests attend So neerer io diuine perfection we ascend Such is true Wisdoms glory that eun they Seeme much to doubt who doe her most admire Whither we properly possesse her may And by continuall industry acquire Or that the Heauns her secretly inspire In briefe no price or gold can her obtaine Shee seemes to be some flame of heaunly fire In Adam breathd before by Folly slaine Which therefore we must seeke to haue from heaun againe Schooles her to be the knowledge doe define Of things diuine and humane which in breast Of Mortalls if it pure and liuely shine Makes him like God vnmoud and stable rest For as no chance of Fortune can molest The Power diuine So wisemen doe enioy Within themselues by Wisdome Peace and Rest Nothing that is without can them annoy All seeming Miseries giue place to Inward Ioy Yet falls this Wisdome short of that Diuine Which Adam did possesse before his fall And as Sunbeames through clouds so doth she shine Through our corruptions scarse discernd at all Wee common and more exquisite her call That see things that are past and things in sight This things which in succeeding times may fall Wee her as shee guides mens affayres aright Call Prudence Wisdome as shee doth in God delight Wisdome and Prudence in an humane breast Are one same Grace though diuers by relation Wisdome referres to God Prudence doth rest Most in a wise and vpright moderation Of States and Men by Laws administration By Wisdome here we see the life of Grace By Prudence in a ciuill conuersation Prudence amongst the heathen had a place True heaunly wisdome only Gods elect doth grace This heaunly wisdome whereby we conuerse With God and take delight in holy things Doth our affections all and wills peruerse Set right and neere diuine perfection brings Shee first like good Musitian tunes the strings And then sends forth a most harmonious sound First lifts our Soules to heaun vpon her wings Next orders all by Prudence on the ground Like Leach who ere he others cure himselfe makes sound She first within in order sets the heart Next is for outward things most prouident No Grace more Good to Mortalls doth impart Nor none more euills here on earth preuent She shews her inward Graces God hath lent By outward manners habit graue attire Few words pure hands in all such complement Such gesture publike and in her retire As all her for a heaunly patterne doe admire But most of all a wiseman striues to tame Both in himselfe and others Sin and Lust For hee that Good from Ill discerns doth blame False varnisht shows defild with inward rust He Pride Pompe Boasting Scorne away doth thrust And from a pure Serenity of mind A paterne draws of Life most quiet iust Far from opinions false and errour blind And guides at sterne as in a calme so in the wind In Warre most valiant in Iudgement iust Ill vnto Good things hurtfull turns to sound Wills still the same because the best no Gust Of fate oppresleth him if Wealth abound Or Pouertie he still the same is found And doth with pleasing Constancy endure All Fortunes changes which doe others wound True innocent sincere iust simple pure And as his Life his Death is ioyfull sweet secure The Poets faine that in the golden Age Graue wise experiencd men bare all the sway And the vnexpert young not yet growne sage To learne Laws rules first practisd to obey For Prudence all by leuell orders ay And by a long Experience doth discerne How she prouide for future changes may By precept and example much we learne But that imprints most deepe which doth our selues concern Examples Precepts and Experience Are euer ready at a Wisemans hand To teach him Iudgement Counsell Prouidence Of which we always here in need doe stand By Counsell we the Grounds doe vnderstand Of things we ought to doe or leaue vndone Iudgement our Wills and Senses doth command What things we ought embrace and what to shun And Prouidence prouides for things that are to come I praise not here that cunning Politie Which maketh of anothers Folly gaine This comes of Malice Guile and Subtiltie Which generous braue Prudence doth disdaine Such always euill counsell entertaine The Apes of Prudence Reasons deprauation Whose minds as hands grow hard by taking paine Are by base plots and subtill magination Inured vnto others wrongs and supplantation As Quicknesse wit As Soundnesse memory Graue lookes the Face and Plainnesse speech commend So Iudgements praise is in Equalitie Without least doing wrong to Foe or Friend And as salt sauours so doth Iudgement bend Eun all our words thoughts workes to good or ill Without this Iudgement Prudence doth intend Nothing for shee is Mistresse of her Will Which she with all her power labours to fulfill Counsell and Iudgement are the very eyes And Lamps here to direct a prudent mind Which they who want or foolishly misprise Walke on in Folly and in Errour blind We many ignorant vaine Fooles doe find So wise in their conceit and estimation They thinke all wisdome in their breasts confind These being bound by double obligation To Folly theres no hope of any reformation Prudence and Folly in the Soule of man Like Health and Sicknesse in his Body are As Health the Body keepes so Prudence can The Soule deliuer from the Deuills snare And as Diseases here the thread doth share Of Bodys Life So Folly soone doth rend The Soule with pleasures vaine and worldly care For as strong men within a Fort defend So Prudent Thoughts our soules from Satans fury shend And as among the noble senses fiue The Sight doth all the rest in worth excell Because all doe their Light from her deriue And shee all that offends them doth repell So Prudence all the vertues doth precell Because by Light God sends her from aboue Shee counsells all the Graces to do well For without her no Grace aright can moue Prudence of all the rest the Gouernour doth proue Vlisses Prudence Aiax Fortitude Whilst they each other doe accompany Win Citys conquer men and monsters rude But if they square for Gaine or Dignity And Aiax leaues Vlisses company His valour turnes to Folly or to rage So men of greatest magnanimity When they the Guidance leaue of Prudence sage Grow beastly mad or foolish in their later age I may her liken to the Prince of Day From whom all lesser Lamps doe borrow Light Who when he doth his glorious Beames display The rest all seeme to be extinguisht quite So when as heaunly Wisdome wondrous bright Her selfe amongst the Graces doth disclose They all doe seeme to vanish in her sight As all the Glory that they haue arose dispose From those bright Beames which wisdome doth on them As God the world The Emperour his host The Gouernour his Ship the Sunne the day And as the Bodys ruled by the Ghost So doth faire Prudence all the vertues sway And as these like good Guides direct the way Vnto their charge to reach their proper end So doth true wisdome all that her obey To endlesse happinesse and pleasure send Most happy man who doth her holy hests attend May his heart die like Nabals churle and foole Or like Achitophel end with a string Laugh in the stocks cleaue to the scorners stoole That listens not to heaunly counselling Of Wisdome and her sweet admonishing Shee hath prouided victualls powrd out wine Sent out her Maids vs to the feast to bring To bid those that seeke Knowledge come and dine And those that Prudence want to tast her grapes diuine For shees the Vine whose grapes yeeld pleasing smell Whose Fruit and Flowers Wealth Life Honour are The Garden where Christ dearest Spouse doth dwell Planted with all the Herbs and Spices rare Which to adorne his Church he doth prepare Would thou one word which should her worth containe He hath true Wisdome who the Lord doth feare And who knows holy things doth entertaine Right vnderstanding without this the rest are vaine She as the Prince or Generall doth guide All other Graces in Loues sacred band Doth order marshall and for them prouide As th Eye which all the members doth command The Gouernours of Men of Cities and Of Families and each mans priuate state She orders wisely by her prudent hand And they that duely on Discretion waite Command the Stars and rule eun ouer Time and Fate As shadows more directly opposite To Sunnes bright Rayes seeme short by being neere When those which are much farther from the light More goodly faire and long by farre appeare So who small Knowledge haue attained here Thereof doe always make a greater show Than those whose vnderstanding shining cleare Doe all the Paths of heaunly wisdome know For with true Wisdome always Humblenesse doth grow And as Gods Wisdome doth no lesser seeme In smallest creatures as a Gnat or Fly Than Greater so we ought no lesse esteeme Wisemen in low degree then Dignitie The Snaile a mirrour is of Politie Who with her hornes keepes always sentinell And neuer commeth out before shee try If things without be all in Peace and well Else she retyring home liues quiet in her shell Oh sonnes of men that you could but behold The wondrous Beauty of this heaunly Peare But nought on earth her Beauty can vnfold Her Glory in the Heauns doth shine most cleare In all Gods workes her splendour doth appeare She first from Heaun vouchsafed to descend To liue in Iudah with her chosen deare But now her Beames more ample doe extend To all the Nations of the earth she light doth lend She taught our Father that was made alone To raise himselfe to Glory from his fall But Enuy turnd from her his foolish sonne And made by Fratricide and Fury fall Loe when the Floud the world destroyed all She it preserues by one wise worke of Wood The dead Sea yet is the memoriall Of foolish Citys fiue which there erst stood Where she saud Lot from fire as Noah from the sloud To tell what wonders haue beene by her wrought Were too to long for this short meditation They in Gods Booke are easily found if sought For there indeed is Wisdoms commendation Where she vs doth with wary obseruation Vnto the Cony and the Pismire send To learne to get our food and habitation Whose meaner Wisdome if we must attend Much more wise Heathens sayings most diuinely pend One being asked who was most wise replyd He that sinnd least when one of them desird To learne who was for youth the trustiest Guid He answerd Prudence And ins sonne requird Only three things which he in youth admird In his tongue silence Prudence in his mind Shamefastnesse in his Face when one requird How he the greatest in the least might find He answerd prudent thoughts in humane breast confind This was an Ethnick But how doth she shine When she is ioynd with pure simplicitie When as that holy wisdome serpentine Combines with douelike true sincerity Oh thus the Saints by holy subtilty Walke safe amongst worlds crooked generation Thus walkd our Sauiour in Humilitie And though the wicked plot his condemnation Yet neuer could they touch him but by subornation Oh how should we that haue this mirrour bright This Sun of Wisdome labour here to shine Like Stars which from the Sun receiue their light And to sincerity true columbine Ioyne this wise holy Prudence serpentine Vs to conduct through this worlds wildernesse And a most safe and perfect way out line Through Iordans waues to Land of Happinesse Where Mansions ready built we shall for ay possesse And Vineyards planted whence the Cananite For wicked Treason gainst his Maiesty God hath expelld to Hell and darkest night Proud Lucifer and all his company Oh why shouldst thou aduance base dust so high Whose earthly Mansion keepes his Spirit low And will not let his vnderstanding flye To see what goodly clusters there doe grow In heaunly Canaan where Milke and Hony flow We hardly here of things below discerne And with great paines what is before vs find Ah how shall we than able be to learne Thy Wisdome which no limits haue confind Thy Spirit onely can into our mind These hidden mysteries in Christ reueale In which the Princes of the world were blind For from man naturall thou dost conceale This Wisdome spirituall which thou to thine dost deale For as none knows the Spirit of a man But that same Spirit that within doth dwell So nothing apprehend this Wisdome can But that wise Spirit that all Truth doth tell Oh Sacred Spirit of Truth my heart compell This holy Sapience to entertaine Thou only giust to drinke of Wisdoms Well Mans wisdoms wickednesse his thoughts are vaine His knowledge is but errour and his pleasure paine Thou didst create eun all things by thy Word And by thy heaunly Wisdome didst ordaine Man of thy handy workes to be the Lord That he in Truth and Equitie might raigne And with an vpright heart the right maintaine Oh therefore downe thine heaunly wisdome send Me in all Truth and vprightnesse to traine She shall my Words and Works to thee commend And bring my small beginnings to a perfect end And here with Praise and Prayer I will end Oh who aright can know or vnderstand Except thou Wisdome from thy Throne dost send To giue vnto him what thou dost command Then grant me Wisdome always to withstand Hells subtill Plots and Worlds base Blandiments Let sacred Prudence euer be at hand Still to direct my words acts and intents To yeeld Obedience to thy Commandements MEDITAT II Of OBEDIENCE WHen first th Almighty by his only Word Had fashiond all within the Firmament He made Man last to be their King and Lord That he to him might be obedient But Man not with this Monarchy content Diuide his homage to omnipotence And hauing but one small Commandement Transgressed it by Disobedience The easier the Command the greater the Offence This all the Sonnes of Adam doe deriue From him and call it guilt Originall Which by th Eternall Law did vs depriue Of all Gods Benefits and did enthrall To endlesse Bondage till Christ for this Fall The price of his most precious bloud did pay Which vs recouers from Sins actuall And by obeying Gods whole Law doth stay His wrath And merits Heaun for all that him obay For as by first mans Disobedience On all men commeth Death and Condemnation So by the seconds true Obedience We haue eternall Life and sure Saluation Thus Disobedience by deriuation From Adam bringeth endlesse wretchednesse And true Obedience by imputation Conuays from Christ eternall Happinesse So by the first comes sin by second Righteousnesse The glorious robe of perfect Righteousnesse Which they that are obedient onely weare To couer that foule shame and wickednesse Which Adams Disobedience layed bare Ah let a Disobedient Sinner dare The aid of the Obedient Lamb desire My Will and Actions Tongue and Heart to square In due proportion to his heaunly squire Whilst I of true Obedience prayses doe enquire Deuoutest Lady Handmaid to the Queene Of heaunly Loue And so in duty bound That shees always prest and ready seene To doe what thing soeuer she propound Her heart words will and deeds all one are found Seruing for Loue and not for Feare or Gaine No Subiect merits better to be crownd For who can best obay he best can raigne And she is shortly sure eternall Crownes to gaine If I may square Her by the Rules of Art I her define to be our Wills subiection To Him that ought to rule both will and heart And by his will disposeth our best affection The rule of Reason may be our direction How our superiours Statutes we obay But when the Lord commands theres no election Nor doubting what we ought to doe or say Gods wills the rule of Right which none may disobey Here in two Branches I might her diuide Obedience first to God and secondly To our Superiours that on earth abide But all is but to one Authority For theres no Power or precedency But that which highest Power doth ordaine Who therefore doth resist mans Soueraignty Gods ordinance resisteth and againe Who duly it obays Gods Statutes doth maintaine Thus must our hearts eares hands be all attent His Word and Will in all things to obey Who ouer vs hath lawfull Regiment Which is one God eternall blest for ay Whose seruants all we are And therefore may Not chuse a Lord or Master whom we will Nor serue two masters least we disobay The one when we the others mind fulfill For that which pleaseth one doth crosse the others will Thus our obedience is only due To him that all did for his seruice make And tis a firme position sound and true God only for himselfe But for his sake All that from him Authoritie doe take We truly and sincerely ought obey Or else our bounden dutie we forsake As those which doe their Princes disobey When they their lawfull Officers commands gainsay For this whole world is like a family In all things well and iustly ordered Where God hath the supreame authority And Rulers theirs from him deliuered By which they doe command as in his stead Who then to them are disobedient They may be said to disobey the Head For whilst they rightly vse their gouernment We ought them to obey in things indifferent Indeed all ought regard the Supreme Will As first commanding cause and end of all Which all that Being haue ought to fulfill From which as all things rise so all must fall Here therefore first we into mind will call To whom that will commands vs to obay For in obeying their commands we shall Obey that Supreme Will This is the way To make Gods Will the Cause of all we doe or say To Him we must be subiect first of all To whom all Power in Heaun and Earth is lent The Sonne of God begotten naturall Next to his Ministers which he hath sent Apostles Pastors Doctors here are meant Which by his Word doe teach their Masters Will And rule his Church by godly Gouernment And those which heare these his commands fulfill And those which them despise despise his heaunly Will As Kings which with great Honour doe conuay Princes Ambassadours it doe intend Vnto their Lords So we our Lord obay When we obey the Legates he doth send The second Power is that which God doth lend To Kings and Princes for to delegate Iudges to punish those which doe offend And to maintaine the Life Peace and estate Of eury member that maintaines the Bodies state To this all Subiects owe Obedience The third obedience is which wife doth owe Vnto her Head who due Beneuolence For Dutie ought vnto his wife to shew For as the Church so ought the Wife to know Her due Subiection vnto her Head And as our Christ directs his Church below So wiues must be by husbands ordered But this of wiues is better knowne then practised So is th obedience which Children owe Vnto their Parents by Commandement And promise they shall long and good days know If they to them will be obedient The fift and last is Masters Gouernment And Seruants Duty which they should them beare Which ought to be with single true intent Not for eyeseruice wages or for feare But as they would obey eun Christ their Master deare Thus ought we to obey these fiue degrees Set ouer vs Because we so obay The highest Power And if their iust decrees We sleight that highest Power we disobay Far wide then disobedient spirits stray Which by Religion would all reuerence Exclude due vnto Magistrates and say They vnto no man owe obedience A false excuse of Schisme and all vnreuerence Obedience preserueth Vnity And helpeth to this great worlds conseruation As Heauns and Earth doe by due Obsequy Obey their glorious Makers Ordination Behold how all things in this worlds Creation Doe by their Makers order stand or moue Earth keepes her Center for mans preseruation The Heauns turne all in motion round aboue Without Obedience one would out another shoue And thus we may Obedience obserue To hold our members in due motion ay Whilst one doth to another member serue And all vnto the Spirit doe obay The Soule of man which doth by reason sway Eun all the members to their preseruation And if the least of them doe disobay Shee either seekes their better reformation Or one endangers all to endlesse condemnation For whilst man here doth on the earth remaine Sin and corruption in his Body dwell Seeking therein as Lord and King to raigne But Grace doth striue by force them to expell If bondslaues we our selues to Sin doe sell And giue our members here Lusts to obay We yeeld vnto such Lusts as lead to Hell But if that Grace our Soule aright doth sway Then all the members follow Her the narrow way Remoue this Vertue of Obedience From Soule or Body Subiect City Towne Or from the Creatures wanting life and sense And all vnto Confusion tumble downe The Tower of Babel might to Heaun haue growne Had all obayd with mutuall diligence But suddainly we see it ouerthrowne When to obay they want intelligence For without vnderstanding no Obedience As to maintaine Heauns perfect vnitie All to one surpeame Trinity obay So all that haue with it Affinitie Subiect themselues to that one God for ay No wonder if those that him disobay To many Errours Schismes and Sects doe fall For one true Vnity they doe gainsay When they resist his Ordinances shall And disobey Gods Word that here directeth all Mee thinkes my Muse could here her selfe transcend By musing of th obedience aboue Which from the Sonne to Father doth ascend And Angells who obeying Feare and Loue Alas what can th eternall Power moue Obedience of poore wretches to require But vs to ioyne to Christ our Head in Loue As he is ioynd to God in due desire Vnto no other end Obedience doth aspire For as when in a wild and fruitlesse stocke We doe some noble impe inoculate The fruit erst base and wild like to the Blocke Is made as goodly faire and delicate As Tree which first this imp did generate So the least imp of Christs Obedience In vs ingraft doth vs regenerate And makes vs beare fruit of like excellence As liuely tree from which it first had influence For all that from stocke of first Adam come Beare those sowre fruits of Disobedience But all that doe ingraft againe become In second Adams true Obedience Bring forth sweet fruits like liuely tree from whence They haue receiued first their sap to spring Swee liuing Vine whose sacred influence Vs makes obedient to our Lord and King Ah who the praises of thy noble fruit can sing It did aduance that holy Prophets quill When He in volume of the booke did find Written that thou shouldst Gods whole Law fulfill Whereto thou wert withall thine heart inclind And when the time was come thereto assignd Thou wert obedient to all Gods will Performing it with all thine heart and mind Evn till the Iewes thee on the Crosse did kill When thou resistedst not though they thy bloud did spill Obedient Lamb this was the sacrifice The offering God did for sin require Thus We must offer vp to God likewise Our Soules and Bodys with like zealous fire To dye if not indeed yet in desire Quick holy acceptable Offering To pacifie Gods Iustice and his Ire Is when to him obedient hearts we bring And crucifie those Lusts which from our Flesh doe spring As from the boundlesse Ocean doe run All streames which doe returne into the Maine So from one paterne of Obedience come All ours and thither doth returne againe The Lamb that was from worlds beginning slaine Gaue the first blow to Disobedience Which Isaack imitates when he is laine On Altar to be sacrificed thence Whom truly Abram offerd by Obedience This was that quiet sauour God did smell When offring one of each cleane bird and beast The good old Noah pleasd the Lord so well Obedience was the Seasoning to the feast What made the Lord Sauls sacrifice detest But that he did his Word then disobey When he did spare of Amalec the best To offer vp But therein did obay His own corrupt inuentions not what God did say Better then Sacrifice is to obay And then the fat of Rams to giue good eare Happy though we doe all the world gaine say If we obay our Lord and Master deare But ah whilst we remaine as Pilgrims here Flesh World and Deuill daily vs perswade To follow Pleasures vaine and to forbeare Obedience to the Lord which vs hath made Whose Statutes to obey should be our onely trade Oh Sacrifice of Fooles with tongue to pray But harbour no obedience in thine heart Who dost in word professe God to obay But by thy workes dost all his Laws peruert Behold it is not without iust desert That Beasts to thee are disobedient When thou to God a faithlesse rebell art To whom obey Sun Moone Stars Firmament Nor Sea against his will inuades the Continent Whilst I about this sinfull Body beare Lusts and corruptions will therein remaine Yet neuer let them so much domineere As here of Grace the mastery to gaine For if I suffer Sinne in me to raigne That all my members will to sinne obay That sin whereof Saint Paul doth so complaine Oh who me from the same deliuer may It is not I but sin that Christ doth disobay If that the Iudge by his Authoritie Inioyne me to performe or speake a thing Against the will of Soueraigne Maiestie Here my Deniall no Offence doth bring And if I be commanded by the King To doe against his will that is aboue I here no Rebell am though suffering For I were better Crosse and Prison proue Than in Gehenna fry from whence is no remoue And as in all humane societies The meaner Power the greater doth obay Till to the Peramount it doth arise Which Power all inferiour powers sway So in this Power Spirituall we may Behold like order for Obedience The Peramount is Gods high Power ay For though we doe all Powers reuerence Yet to the highest we haue always reference What more vniust than looke to be obayd By our inferiours and to disobay Those God hath placd aboue vs for our aid Ah how Thy will be done may we here pray As Angells doe the same in Heaun for ay Which we so often crosse by doing ill More often then are minutes in a day Oh let my Heart be ready to fulfill Mine Heart be ready Lord to learne and doe thy will Ready in all things lawfull to obay Superiours all to doe things iust and right To Loue my Neighbour for mine enemys pray Grace to embrace and with Corruptions fight To cast off earthly things and to delight Wholly in God and heaunly contemplation To worke by day to watch and pray by night To learne of Christ Meeknesse Humiliation With trembling and with Feare to worke out my Saluation Since I must be obedient to the end How should I end to beg Obedience Obedience which to Liberty doth tend And vs restores vnto that excellence Which Adam lost by Disobedience Let others glory in their mightie traine And large command of many Continents By Meeknesse and Obedience I shall gaine With Meeke obedient Lamb in Heaun for ay to raigne MEDITAT III Of MEEKNESSE AS in faire Garden where variety Of choisest Flowers the senses to delight Are plact by cunning hand most curiously Their diuers colours most effect the sight That broad and fairest shew and stand vpright But oft we find low creeping on the ground An hearb whose odour sweet doth more inuite Our smells than all the Tuslips there are found So is it with this Grace which I doe next propound For though the goodliest Garden of the Bride Like Eden is so faire embelished With richest Fruits and Flowers from side to side Their names and hues cannot be numbered Much lesse their Force and Natures be aread And though all are more glorious to be seene Than Meeknesse which is next disciphered Yet none more pleasing to our smell I weene Nor more than her respected of Loues royall Queene Obedience Meeknesse and Humility Are Flowers more for profit than for show Pleasing the smell and taste more than the eye And lowly like sweet Thyme and Hysope grow These by the outward face we must not know Their inward vertue tis that we esteeme Their Force is heaunly though their dwellings low And may the greatest Monarch here beseeme For sure the King of Kings like these himselfe did deeme And vs commandeth all of him to learne Meeknesse and lowlinesse which rest doth bring Eternall Rest which doth our Soules concerne Here more than any vaine and worldly thing Most mighty God and yet the meekest King Fit thou my Soule for this sweet Meditation And teach me meeknesse whilst I meeknesse sing Which base and meane in mans vaine estimation Is with the Lord of Lords of highest valuation Some her define to be a Moderation Of Anger And would haue her to abstaine From all reuengefull furious enuious passion Thereby possession of her soule to gaine For who doth gentle meeknesse entertaine With her finds happy Peace and quiet Rest And who from furious rage will not refraine But harbours wrath and malice in his Brest Possesseth not himselfe but is by them possest Meeke gentle milde soft affable and kind In words though diuers are in sense the same And come from gentle habit of the mind Which like it selfe our words and acts doth frame Making wild sauage furious creatures tame For all are mad and wild since Adams fall And burne in furious and reuengfull flame But meeknesse mitigates appeasing all And blessed here in peace the earth inherit shall Meeknesse which pleaseth God and profits man For God the meeke exalteth to Saluation And those which here abstaine from Anger can In multitude of Peace haue delectation With meeke far better is humiliation Than greatest spoiles with proud ones to diuide Heaunly Hierusalems no habitation For those which Right by Duells doe decide But those which can with meeknesse iniurys abide She ire and rancour in her heart can brooke But doth all with an equall mind sustaine Prouokd by none nor doth she one prouoke Though oft offended hurteth none againe She doth from all improbity abstaine Resists not euill but the same with good Still ouercomes And doth more glory gaine By gentle yeelding than if she withstood The wicked in his raging furious angry mood Oh Grace most glorious when God Her sends To dwell in breast of some great Potentate His Heart She from all Crueltie defends And though he be a Lord of Life and Fate His hands with bloud doth not contaminate She such a Prince to Heaun at length will bring Too soone for vs though he may thinke it late Let Homer fierce Achilles praises sing Giue me a mercifull meeke mild and gentle King For Meeknesse brings more honour to a King Than Purple Scepter Diademe or Crowne And richer triumphs doth to Emperours bring Than winning any Castle Fort or Towne He gets eternall Glory and renowne Who can by meeknesse bridle passions right Let Tyrants rage and let the Furys frowne They can no more a good meeke man affright Than Arrows hurt the water that thereon doe light Inhumane crueltys taught in the schoole Of Satan who would like himselfe haue all But he whose seats in Heaun and his footstoole Vpon the earth Before whose presence fall Downe all the Angells and him Maker call Bids vs like to himselfe be meeke and low For he that turnd to sweet that cup of gall Can make the meeke and lowly highest grow And with one blast the proud and cruell ouerthrow I labour not to keepe downe or depresse That humane natures high sublimitie Without which creatures beare no awfulnesse Nor due respect vnto the Maiesty God hath annexed to mans Soueraignty I seeke to suit his mind and conscience Vnto his outward Grace and Dignity And raise him by an inward confidence Of welknowne worth to an angelike excellence Yet not by this sublimity to swell Beyond the bounds of Mortalls He thats wise Will as his worth and due deserts excell Be still more low and humble ins owne eyes And as his State and Honour here doe rise Hee is more modest gentle meeke and kind Preferring not himselfe in any wise Before his equalls thus he grace doth find By gentle manswetude with God and all mankind For whilst by an obsequious conuersation And by ingenuous manners pleasing sweet Far from base flattery as vaine ostentation Hee doth inferiours equalls betters greet By loosing of his owne Lo he doth get In others thoughts the highest estimation His Heads in heaun though on the earth his feet And by anothers vertues veneration He getteth of his owne all loue and admiration Oh happy man to whom heauns King hath sent This Grace to be the glory of the rest What can that mind molest or discontent That harbours gracious meeknesse in his brest They that can contumely faire disgest If any them deride or reprehend Streight of themselues take more seuere inquest If ought be iustly blamd they soone amend If false it neuer them shall anger or offend Meeke gentle patient bearing right or wrong From inward free as outward perturbation Reuenge is not a thing that doth belong To her she finds far greater contentation In wrongs dissembling and their tolleration The wants which she within her selfe doth find Her more depresse by modest moderation Than all her vertues eleuate her mind As salt she sauours all the vertues in their kind This is the same or very like the Grace Which we doe call Christian Humilitie Without which other vertues haue no place All are in her as in an Vnitie She is the surest way to Dignitie The center where all vertues lines doe meet Most honourd when she most doth vilifie Her selfe And when she stoops to wash Saints feet The highest King of Kings with kisses her doth greet Yet none of worldlings is esteemd more vile They it account a thing too meane and base Here to discend vnto so low a stile They thinke that meeknesse valour doth disgrace But oh absurd presumptuous mortall race So high and proud in thine owne estimation What things created in more wretched case Weake vaine precipite and on each occasion Ready to fall from highest hopes to desperation What is thy Body but fraile quickned clay Thy Soules so clouded with obscurity It is most ready prone precipite ay To fall to basenesse errour vanity Happy who sees his owne infirmity Thus By discending only we ascend Vnto the highest humane dignity First step to honour is to vilipend Our selues Let others thee and not thy selfe commend None seekes to pull his foot out of the mire Vntill he feeles and knows that it is in Nor none to wash the durt off doth desire Vntill he sees it cleaue vnto his skin So till this Grace vs shews our selues within We neuer seeke those heaunly remedies To purge our soules from error and foule sinne This was of all the Oracles most wise First know thy selfe that is thine owne infirmities Thus comes the purest wheat from foulest ground So it be first well tilld and harrowed And thus the ignorant grow men profound When they their folly haue discouered Of all the vertues can be reckoned The roots are bitter fruits most sweet doe proue Selfe Pride and Arrogance once settled In humane Brest most hard are to remoue This worke belongs to meeknesse humblenesse and Loue Most pleasant fruits which from this root do spring When weeding out base pleasures false and vaine She true delight into their roomes doth bring And rich Content for euer to remaine Happy who can this Ladys fauour gaine Shee able is and ready to defend Against Soules troubles and the bodys paine The meeke that patiently on God attend Are sure to haue a joyfull quiet happy end Nothing can his most noble mind appall Which is with such Tranquillity indude Crosses Afflictions may him here befall But base or abiect thoughts cannot intrude Into a mind of such an habitude Certaine his breast all vertues doth containe Who hath this gentle vertue manswetude Who wants her boasts of vertue but in vaine They are but shews of vertue which with him remaine It is the height of folly to bewray Desire where we haue no power to offend So beat the Sea if it will not obay Or winds which crosse the way thou dost intend So whom thou canst not reach his picture rend Such wounds make arrows when they cleane the aire Yet many thus with rage their spirits spend Were it not better farre to beare them faire But Folly cannot beare though thou in morter bray her If an Asse kicks thee must thou kicke againe Or barks a Dog wilt thou straight baule and cry Because ones foolish canst thou not refraine But needs doe that is ill for company Let fooles scorne meane Birth want deformity This if a fault not thine thy Makers is To him thats meeke no infelicity Can fall by Fortunes bitter frownes or blisse He counts them not his owne true vertues only his I liken Meeknesse to that peece of wood Wherewith the Prophet did the Fountaines heale And made the bitter waters sweet and good For so doth Meeknesse with Afflictions deale She all their bitternesse with Ioy doth seale Evn that accursed death vpon a Tree She turneth from a Curse vnto our Weale Blest are the Meeke that for welldoing be Hangd thereupon from thence they Paradise may see A meeke mans minds like solitary place Where all is quiet fit for Contemplation And to behold his Makers Will and Grace Spending his time in sweetest meditation But cruell minds are full of perturbation Like to a Market or tumultuous Faire Where all is filld with noise and molestation Durt in the streets strong clamours in the aire Such places are vnfit for Graces sweet repaire A meeke minds like vnto Pernassus Hill Through whose pure aire shines Phoebus golden ray Whose siluer Channells purest Fountaine fill And all the meades bedeck with Lillys gay The Gardens with faire Flowers adorned ay And when the Brookes doe murmur any sound With much delight sweet Zephirus doth play And all the Birds vpon the trees around Consort with Muses nine to make a Heavnly sound But a meeke mind more pleasing is then all These Flowers Fruits or Musickes sweet delight No fit of Fury can that Heart appall For as a Dart may on the water light And hurts it not by any force or might So Force not Fury can meeke mind offend For it giues way as doth the water light Oh happy quiet mind that doth attend With meeknesse on Gods bounteous goodnesse to the end As when the glorious Sunbeames doe appeare All misty cloudinesse is turnd to day So where this Grace the heart of men doth cheare All passions turbulent are driun away Then mecknesse most her Glory doth display When shee hath iustest cause to take offence No valour like this Dames behold we may Nor any like her modest Patience A meeke and lowly mind excells all ornaments As when the Lord of all to vs did come In humane flesh he peace and concord bred Twixt Men and Angells and made all become As one in peace and quiet in their head So where this meeknesse doth her Grace dispred There Nations Neighbours Kindred all we find Lately at Discord now fast fettered In Loue and Friendships Bands which firmly bind No surer band of loue than meeke and gentle mind In golden Age when as the Poets faine Men Beasts Fish Foule to be at amity This Lady Mecknesse as a Queene did raigne And vnder Loue had all Authoritie But since the Iron Age which enmity Hath raisd in eury Riuer Towne and Field Shee hath resignd her place of Soueraigntie To Iustice and delights now more to yeeld Than Scepters in age so turbulent to weeld And for she knows the noble gentle mind Most sensible of wrong and iniury And few or none can here so constant find As to dissemble foule indignity She all requests that loue her company Occasions to auoid and not inuite Which may prouoke least iarre or simulty Aed not like teachy Curres to barke and bite Or Frogs which Poets faine with Bulrushes to fight If thus they cannot as who ay can here Auoid some iniurys of them that reigne They must dissemble and with pleasing cheere What they can no wayes shift faire entertaine One askd how such old age he did attaine In Court replyd by bearing Iniurys Sometimes remitting and sometimes againe For them gaue thankes thus surely he thats wise By suffring beares and not prouokes indignities And since no earthly Powers so great and firme But Iniury sometimes will dare to smite Let Wisdoms precepts so thee ay confirme Thou neuer swerue from rules of Reason right So armd the wrongs which on thine armor light Shall backe on him that sent the same rebound But whom vnarmd she can prouoke to fight Though happily they thinke her to confound They sure are to receiue a deepe and festring wound He stands not right whom Iniury can bow Who ill beare old doe on them new inuite But he that beares the old with Patience how Shall any new be able him to smite He that is wise and valiant scornes her might And by braue bearing doth her spite confound He best orecomes that sets by her most light Who by impatience addes is like him found That doth by rending make incurable his wound In many wrongs tis better to be mute Than by repeating them oft very small To cause long trouble or a tedious suit Whilst all the shame doth on thauenger fall Such better were not mentioned at all Inuoke the helpe of constant Patience Whose presence doth all Iniurys appall And with an equall mind beares all offence Or doth despise them in her guiltlesse conscience Thus many offring doe no Iniurys Because they are not so conceivd or taken Oh happy who all wrong can so despise With sense thereof nere to be ouertaken Whose vnmovd constant mind is neuer shaken So farre from muttring or least murmuring He laughs and smiles to see them so mistaken Nors only easie in their pardoning But passeth by them without least acknowledging He is aboue the reach of Iniuries Who can represse reuenges curst desire And to the full repays his enemies Who thus can quench wraths hot iniurious fire Yet holy meeknesse leads vs a step higher Happy who can ascend vnto such height It is the summity which all admire Of highest vertue when we take delight All Iniurys with Benefits here to requite The jest is lost if it no laughter moue Sos Contumely if it be neglected He neuer will a valiant Souldier proue To beare hot Blows that is with words affected He sooner is with noisome smells infected Who them with open nose doth entertaine Than he that stops it or beares some selected Preseruatiue for to defend his braine So tis to stop or ope our eares to proud Disdaine Poets paint Scylla with a womans face But like a Dog in neather parts and taile Whom Hercules th Idea of all Grace And Vertue did amongst the monsters quaile You giue her Life if you will heare her raile But shut her mouth with patient suffering Or stop thine eares and soone her breath will faile Here Mecknesse ends and here I cease to sing Shee doth more quiet Rest than all the Vertues bring MEDITAT IIII GODS WORD SO mighty are the weapons manifold Wherewith our spirituall Foes doe vs assaile So many stratagems vs to infold So many terrours vaine our hearts to quaile That neither Brestplate Helmet Shield or Maile Vs helpe against their Forces can afford For if they close with vs they will preuaile Therefore we must vnsheath our keenest Sword Our weapon spirituall evn Gods most holy Word Which those that able are to wield aright Of farre more Force and liuely Power find Than all the weapons whereof Poets write To haue beene wondrous powrfull in their kind What Homer of Achilles Speare hath coynd I not vnfitly to this Sword apply Whose wounds to heale no Balme could be assignd The Speare that hurt must only remedy So whom this Sword doth kill this Sword must viuifie Of wondrous weapons Heathen Poets tell Of Stygian Armour and enchanted Swords Whereby small Knights did monstrous Gyants quell Subdude and raigned ouer them as Lords Such fiction to vs good aduice affords Against these Gyants spirituall to fight Our Fleshly Lusts and for to bind in Cords Our vaine affections here that take delight In doing that is wrong and leauing that is right God of all might that hast vs giun this sword Not only spirituall Battailes here to fight But dost engraue in it as on record Thy Rules whereby we muster may aright The Lanthorne to our paths our feets best light Direct my Muse to sing I humbly pray Of this thy Word by holy Words insight For but by it none can aright display That Swords eternall Power which Sin and Hell dismay That Word which in Beginning by a word Of Nothing made Heaun Earth and Creatures all And was from all Beginning God and Lord Doth not within my Muses compasse fall That Word whereof now meditate I shall Is that reuealed written veritie Which first and second Testament we call Both which were first declared mightily By wonders signes and miracles from God on high For as the Lord most mighty wonders wrought By him that publikely did first record This sacred Word And by his Hand forth brought His Sonnes from Bondage of a cruell Lord So those to whom he did this Grace afford Of publishing his later Testament Wrought mighty wonders by this mighty Word To all Beholders great astonishment Confirming thus that they from God aboue were sent From whom this Word hath all Authority For by the holy Spirits inspiration Came Law and Gospell Prophets History And all Canonicall wise ordination The sacred Light that giues illumination Vntill the Daystarre in our Hearts arise Whose heaunly Wisdome breedeth Admiration In all their Hearts that are diuinely wise But folly seemes to such as sinne doth blind their eys And sure it is a mighty powrfull Word If that the sense thereof be right applyd More keene than any sharpe two edged sword And eun the Soule and Spirit doth diuide By it are all our Hearts intents descryd The ioynts and marrow it doth smite in sunder No Creature from her sight it selfe can hide All high exalted things it bringeth vnder And gainst all disobedience soundeth out like thunder This was the Sword wherewith our valiant Head When he was tempted in the Wildernesse And with a sixweekesfast sore weakened Did free himselfe from Hells malitiousnesse When first on him his Enemy did presse He vsd the hilts himselfe for to defend But when he could not thus his Foe represse Loe he the point against his Breast doth bend Behind me Satan All Gods worship must attend Those that will vse aright this holy Word Must not the letter but the sense apply Or else they vse the Scabbard for the Sword Wherewith none euer wun the Victory It is the Mystery of Iniquitie To take the letter and to leaue the sense To forge of Antichrists Idolatry The feigned Rocke the Keys of Heaun from whence He claimes to vniuersall Power Obedience A multitude of words but all one sense And tending all to that grand mystery To which all mysteries haue reference Mans personall vnion with the Deity The which to God was knowne infallibly In his election ere the worlds Foundation And all the Bookes it seemes to typifie From Genesis vnto the Reuelation Sublime transcendent mysterys of mans Saluation How should my Muse these hope to comprehend In this short fainting breath of meditation Which doth all humane wit and skill transcend Whose each word hath an hid signification Each letter pricke and point an obseruation All fauouring of Wisdome true diuine And far beyond mans weake inuestigation In it such rare profound deepe Learning shine A Volume is not able to expound a Line Fie then on those that swolne with vaine ambition To sway all Kingdomes with materiall sword Preferre before this Word their vaine tradition Which nought but vainnesse like themselues afford Their names be wiped out of the Record And Booke which all thy Saints names doth containe That thus doe seeke to vilifie this Word Which to accomplish Gods owne Sonne was slaine And thousand Martyrs spent their bloud it to maintain So deale with Prophets that to hide conspire From simple people Food spirituall Which they as new borne Babes do milke desire That they may grow vp to be strong and tall I grant as Mothers breasts doe best of all Nourish the Child so doth Gods holy Word Which from our MotherChurches breasts doth fall Best nourishment vnto her Babes afford So as it be sincere Else be it all abhord True Angells Food sweet Manna pure diuine My Spirits dayly bread and nourishment Which wanting shee doth hunger statue and pine And yeeld to Bodys sleshly Regiment My Soule with fat and marrow is content When I with ioyfull lips thy praises sing And feed upon thy Lawes great wonderment Which to subiection doth my Body bring And makes the Spirit rule and order like a King The Spirit it compares to Looking Glasse Where we our Faces Spots may all behold But soone out of our memory they passe Like to a Dreame or Tale thats idlely told But who his mind thereon doth daily hold Doth walke in perfect Law of Liberty Which to him doth apparantly vnfold His Soule and Fleshes least deformity And sheweth him the meanes the same to rectifie Eun as the Raine indiffereutly doth fall Vpon the fruitfull and the barren ground So preached is this Heaunly Word to all Though to the faithlesse it be fruitlesse found Oh where this Word doth powerfully sound The strongest holds of sin it shatters downe And things most high exalted doth confound Its smallestSeed in lowly Valley sowne Est suddenly is to a mighty Cedar growne It is reported of the siluer Doue She neere the purest Streames doth most delight In which Shee may espy the shadow moue Of towring Faulcon or the rauenning Kite Whereby she is forewarnd to scape by flight From cruell Hawkes that seeke her for a pray So if in spirituall streames we take delight Our spirituall Foes we there discouer may That so our Soules forewarnd like Doues might flye away Most glorious Sunshine where it doth enlight More comfortable Light hath showne But when Shee doth withdraw her Beames is night And darknesse spirituall far grosser growne Than that which three days was to Pharaoh knowne Hardhearted Pharaoh thou that didst despise This Word and all the wonders by it showne Eun all thy plagues light on them that deuise To hide this heaunly Light from simple peoples eys It is the doore whereby the pastours may Spiritually ascend into their Fold Those that doe enter in another way We doe as rauenning wolues and robbers hold This Words a touchstone which doth try from Gold All mettalls base Inuentions of mans braine Of which such store at Latium now are sold Not for the Flocks but for the Shepheards gaine Masse Dirges Pardons Trentalls and Traditions vaine Nothing describe her nature better will Than Touchstone thvse of which simplest may learne But one had need of cunning Goldsmiths skill True Touchstone from a false one to discerne Oh how did those noble Berreans earne To try those things that Paul deliuered The things which our Saluation did concerne By that which in the Scriptures they had read The Scriptures that the Spirit had canonized Who from the simple people these doe hide Deale as with Israel did the Cananite Who no Smith sufferd in their Coasts tabide To make a weapon for an Israelite Therfore no speare nor sword when they should fight But in Sauls hands and Ionathans were found Chams hellish pollicy most deulish sleight To hold in Ignorance and Bondage bold By taking way such helpes as Liberty propound As first God by his Word and Spirit wrought And fashiond all things in this worlds Creation So by this Word and Spirit he hath brought All things to passe in this our renouation And as he for our Bodyes preseruation Hath here materiall Bread and Wine prepard Sos Word and Spirit is for sustentation Of all our Soules that rightly it regard Such neuer need of thirst and hunger be afeard As Appetites a Signe of Bodys Health So of the Soules is hunger of his Word And as to him that seeketh store of wealth A Myne can best what he desires afford So he that spirituall treasures vp would hoard Come to this sacred Word where he shall find It doth a world of mysterys record The richest jewells to adorne the mind True treasures no where else reuealed to mankind For its the Megazine where pastours haue All gems and treasures to enrich their fold The storehouse whence they all abundance craue Of liuing food their Lambs in plight to

of blessed heaunly Quire Whose Praise eun all the heaunly Powers sing Apostles Prophets Martyrs all desire With all their might to strike this lofty string Which Dauid in one Psalme a thousand times doth ring As Iacob with the Angell wrestled Nor let him goe without a blessing would So when words mysteries by vs are read We striue and struggle for the meaning should A goodly strife if we contending could Hold out till what we seeke we doe obtaine As Incense doth no pleasing smell vnfold Nor Spice till it be in a Morter braine So are words mysteries till study makes them plaine This

his Body with his Sheild Then him thus taught and traind he leads into the Field So wee that in these Spirituall Battells fight Not with fraile Flesh but Principalitys And powers of exceeding foce and might Besides their treason plots and policies Must first be taught in Armes to exercise That all in complete Armour ordered And taught how to assault our enemys They with our Sword may be discomfited And we from Hell and Bondage safe deliuered I of this Military Art doe know No Tutor like to holy supplication Prayer who vse of all our Armes doth show The Serieant Maior of our Militation Diuinest Prayer holy Meditation Whereby with God we haue sweet conference About the mysteries of Mans Saluation And call the Angells downe for our defence Gainst Fleshs Worlds and Deuils hostile violence Prayer who though her knees bow in the dust Yet are her vpper parts aboue the sky And doe into th Almightys presence thrust To craue of all we want a new supply Which like to clouds of incense vp doe flye If offered by his Sonnes sweet mediation Whose iust requests no Father can deny Oh offer mine then That this Meditation May be directed by thy Spirits illumination True Prayer is the opening the desire Evn of our Heart and Soule to God aright Them powring out to him that doth require We should lay open all before his sight The Sacrifice wherein he doth delight A sure defence to him that right doth pray The Scourge wherewith we Sin and Satan smite And powers all and policies gainsay Our surest Refuge in each dangerous Affray For Christian Souldier neuer kneeleth downe And lifts his heart vp towards Heavn to pray But all his Foes spirituall him arowne Assault and labour him herein to stay Then is it time for him about to lay With his sharp Sword to put them all to flight And for to arme each part lest they him slay With Greaues Belt Brestplate Shield and Helmet bright In Faith Hope Patience Truth and Righteousnesse to fight By rules of Art I Prayer may diuide To these two Heads Thankesgiuing Inuocation The second I in three doe subdiuide Petition Intercession Deprecation First seekes Gods Glory and our owne Saluation The second doth for others make petition So Christ doth intercede by mediation By last we doe intreat for sins remission And be deliuerd from all ill and superstition But as the Sauldier be he nere so strong Well armd and skild in points of Schooledefence If that his spirit faint is laid along So if we in our Armes haue confidence And not relye on Gods sole Prouidence His Spirit which helpeth our infirmities And doth instruct to pray with reuerence Sending vp heart and soule by sighs and crys For all our Armes and strength our Foes will vs surprise For Spirit is the cause efficient Of all our prayers that to Heavn ascend Though Faith be the Internall instrument By which we all things aske doe apprehend With Faith and Spirit Prayer Heavn doth rend And whatsoeuer shee in Christ his name Doth aske the Father downe to vs will send This Pagans saw though otherwise to blame That Christians nothing beg but they obtaine the same All Blessings spirituall and temporall Publike and priuate for our Selues and Friends All that in this life or a better fall To vs almighty God for Prayer sends When Heaun is shut vp that no dew descends If we forsake our sins and pray for raine The Heaun on vs abundant showers spends Though Foes vs captiue from our Citys traine Yet Prayer makes vs Free and brings vs home againe If Dearth Drowth Pestilence be in the Land Or Citys be besiegd by enemies Then if the cause thereof we vnderstand Our sins And seeke by Prayer remedy God will be mercifull accordingly Yea if a Stranger of an Heathen Nation Doe call on God by Prayer heartily And of his life doe seeke a reformation His Prayer shall be heard by Christ his mediation Thus Prayer is for all things profitable If her true obiect she doe neuer misse One God who gracious willing is and able And of our Heart the only Searcher is All things that are in Heaun and Earth are his We must no person in the Deity Omit when as we pray to him for Blisse All workes externall in the Trinity Are one though their internall haue variety Diuinest Paternoster whose one Word In it more heaunly matter doth containe Than one whole hours babbling can afford Suddaine abortiues of an idle braine With tedious turnings repetitions vaine Out tumbling all that in their stomach lies Which often goe beyond this Prayers straine As if they were more feruent or more wise Than he that for our patterne did it first deuise Pure Prayer made by serious meditation Or by this holy patterne rightly pend Briefe spirituall sublime ejaculation With feruent Fury doth to Heaun ascend And to the marke like swiftest arrow tend God is in Heaun thou kneelest on the ground To him therefore no rash petitions send Therein let matter more than words abound And inward sighs and groanes than outward plaints and sound But Prayer though by thy two mighty wings Of Loue and Meeknesse thou to Heaun canst sore And come in presence of the King of Kings By pardning wrongs and giuing to the poore Presume not on thy merits ere the more That Brightnesse who doth sit vpon the Throne Angells not able are to stand before Alas how darst thou then there stand alone Without the mediation of the Holy One Like birdlime merits so thy wings besmeare That thou not able art to take thy slight Aboue the Firmament or to come neere That euershining Lamp of Heaunly Light Which ought thy Prayers to direct aright In Knowledge Meeknesse and Humility By which we feele and haue and inward sight Of our vnworthinesse and misery And seeke else where for worth and true felicity Eun to that liuely Fountaine of the Lamb Which is a deepe well wondrously profound From which by Prayer breaking vp the dam We draw vp waters which doe there abound The depth of this rich Well no Grace can sound But feruent Prayer when as Shee doth desire To coole her thirst with waters therein found wherewith if once we coole our thirst like Fire The more we drinke thereof the hotters our desire An Oxes lowing barking of a Dog Grunting of Swine doth more the Lord delight Than Prayers which the World and Flesh so clog They come not from vs with a Heart and Sprite And as no salue or medicine hath might To heale the wound which Iron doth containe So Prayer neuer profiteth that wight In whom Hypocrisie or guile remaine For these still fester deeper to the Patients paine God is our Soules Physitian and knows best What for her sicknesse is best remedy And therfore when we needfull things request Of him for this our lifes necessitie He better then his Patient can descry What is most fit to keepe him from the graue And cure him of his spirituall malady Wherefore when we receiue not what we craue We know Christ better knows than we what need we haue Gods Words the Sword whereby our Lord doth sway And rules his Church here as he is a King As Priest he offers praises and doth pray As Prophet he glad tidings vs doth bring Most wisely teaching and admonishing Thus Aaronlike to God he doth present Our prayers praises tythes and offering For Aarons Office Christs did represent And makes them giue to God an acceptable sent Prayer is mans best fence the Angells ioy The Deuills torture Gods sweet sacrifice We by her meanes all blessings here enioy By prayer we obtaine here to be wise By prayer with th Almighty we aduise By reading he doth answere vs againe But our Liplabour he doth all despise Ah what doe then those simple people gaine Which in a tongue vnknowne doe mutter praiers vaine Oh when the Spirit with vnderstanding prays And evn the Heart with sighs and groanes vp sends To him that willing able is always Vs from Hell Death and danger to defend Then as a Bullet doth the welkin rend Blowne with the force of Powder and of Fire So doe our Prayers vp to Heaun ascend By Zeale and Force of spirituall desire Where they of God obtaine all things they can require Moses gainst Amalec doth more preuaile By Prayer and by holding vp his hands Then mighty Iosuah though he doth assaile Them with his strong and most selected bands At Iosuahs short sweet Prayer the Sun still stands Till hees auenged of his enemys Elisha all the Host of God commands Him to relieue in his necessitys Evn Fiery Horse and Charrets keep him where he lies Prayer is able by plaine strength to wring From handbreadth Cloud an Ocean of Raine And Captiues out of Babylon to bring To worship in Hierusalem againe The Angell strivd with Iacob but in vaine Without a Blessing he will not vnloose Zenacharibs whole Host was spoyld and slaine By Hezekias Prayer when we close With God by Prayer we our holds must neuer loose The Rainshorns Trumpets which seavn Priests did blow Most liuely doe strong Prayer represent Which with the peoples shout did ouerthrow Proud walls of Iericho to astonishment Of all the wicked that therein are pent This was the musick Aarons sonnes did sound With Trumpets when to warre the people went When Daniel in Lyons Den was found True Prayer from their jawes him kept both safe and sound Tis not our words God lookes on but the mind Not to the place but to the true intent In dungeon Ieremy did comfort find And Iob vpon the dunghill takes content Three Children in the fiery Fornace pent Are heard when Praises they to God doe sing The Thiefe from Crosse as gratefull Prayers sent As from his Temple Solomon the King The Hermits Cell may oft as loud as Steeple ring Not that from publike Prayer I purloine Of which Gods house hath her denomination Where Priests and peoples hearts and voices ioyn To teare the skies with cryes and supplication Oh Force vnited of a Congregation In Gods owne house of Prayer gathered For Praise Petition or for Deprecation God nought denyeth so petitioned And wee thus from all euill are deliuered When Peter slept with chaines in prison bound On each side Souldiers Keepers at the doore The Church doth pray though hee sleepe fast and sound And God him loosed from his chaines therefore And when the Angell lighteth him before The Iron Gate opes of his owne accord Pauls Dauids Samuells a thousand more Of Prayers you may find vpon record All which may seem to bind toth Peace our angry Lord I all conclude with his most heavnly one Who did in days of his Humility With loudest crys in Spirit sigh and groane For Freedome of that dire calamity Which came on him for our Iniquitie And though he Legions could of Angells call To saue him from inhumane cruelty Yet Lamblike did before his Shearer fall Submitting to his Fathers will and pleasure all Without vs God will nothing for vs doe We therefore must prepare to fight alway And without God we can nor stand nor goe And therefore must be alwayes swift to pray If these so prayd when Foes did them assay When Flesh and Bloud with Flesh and Bloud did fight What shall we in this dangerous great affray When we encounter with spirituall might Which in his Agony did Christ our Head affright But ah we at our first conuersion pray Most feruently oft for the nouelty But after negligent cold sleeping say Our Paternoster in security Thou sleepst secure but ah thine Enemy Doth watch thee thyn evn napping to surprise We then to God withall our hearts doe cry When as no thoughts withdraw vs otherwise Alas but few or none pray often in this wise Oh that a man of base and filthy mould Should dare fall downe before Gods glorious Throne His wants and imperfections to vnfold And haue his heart like Nabals dead as stone When Angells that come neere that holy One Are faine their face to couer with their wings So bright his Glorious Maiesty hath showne Who is the Lord of Lords and King of Kings The searcher of our reines and tryer of all things When I no longer able am to fight Like Moses let me lift vp hands and pray Against the inuisible Amalekite That spiritually doth seeke my soule to slay When I with Faith two words Our Father say I pardon beg for Sin Freedome from paine Gods Heyre and Sonne Christs Brother I that day Am made and gifts of Holy Ghost doe gaine Then let me neuer mumble ouer words in vaine But I confesse though I doe often proue There is no comfort like this one to pray That is bestowd on man from Heavn aboue Yet find I Satan prest and busie ay Mee in this holy duty to assay By wandring Thoughts and vaine imaginations Which oftdoe lead my Mind so far astray I am bereaud of Heavnly cogitations And change for idle fancys holy meditations But Prayer doth so please my Muses straine That I omitted haue of Praise to sing The Sacrifice we offer here againe For all the Bounty of our heavnly King I liken her to Prayers either wing Forgiuing wrongs and Almes vnto the poore Our holy liuely spirituall Offering Of Body Soule Heart Tongue and all our store With true Obedience to God for euermore Whilst here of Benefits no end we find How should we euer make an end of praise Oh happy Bands that vs for euer bind Evn when our Soules and Bodys Chrisi shall raise Our praise shall be eternall like our days He that his time in praise and hymnes would spend I him referre to Dauids heavnly Layes Diuinely by the holy Spirit pend My Muse now out of Breath cannot this Mount ascend Oh let my voyce and heart together ioyne God of the lips accepts not but the heart Grant that my life in Holinesse may shine That Conscience may euer beare apart Presumptuous man that darst thy Maker thwart To poure out fond petitions base and vaine When thou considrest before whom thou art Him that doth all leud lying lips disdaine And Hypocrites rewardeth with infernall paine If prayer be right pure sincere and meeke It neuer empty shall returne againe For God will either grant vs what we seeke Or giue vs that shall be our greater gaine Mine Heart mine heart Lord doth reioyce amaine Ay in thine House of Prayer to abide Where Swallows build and Sparrows are full faine To lay their young ones by thine Altars side Mee neuer let the Spirit of Prayer be denyd But since I ought to pray continually How should my Pen of Prayer make an end My Sauiour praying on the Crosse did dye With Prayer Steuen his Soule to Heavn did send But I began with

began many kyngdoms the most of those kyngdoms was the kyngdome of Scitarum But there were soo many rude boystous people in it that cyte was neuer hadde in worshyp And it was a stronge and a myghty regyon of dystau ce And about this tyme began the kyngdome of Egept the whiche with dyuers and many alteracyons often tymes was chaunged also it is spoken of many tymes in scrypture Noblynesse or gentylmen about this sayd tyme beganne And this noblynesse or gentylmen was ordeyned for many causes The fyrst cause was necessyte For whan makend drewe sore men were prompte redy to doo euyll it was very necessary to withstande the greate malyce of the cursyd people agaynste good men Ther of a man is called a gentylma or a nobleman as before other in vertues notable wher of Ierom sayth I see no thynge elles in noblesse or i gentylmen bute that they are bounden in a creteyn necessyte that they shall not recede fro the vertue and the gentylnesse of ther noble auncetours The seconde was the dyuers worshyppynge of the people For no man worshypt thenne but as hys naturall reason gaaf And they knewe not ryghtwysly what they sholde worshyp all thoughe they lyued peasyble amonge themself For they were so dull of wytte that they coude pondre no grete thynge but ye was publysshed by the comyn people wherfore it was expedyent for ther peas be kept that they sholde haue princes of noble byrth The thyrde cause procedeth of some synguler strength Many tymes the comynalte were greued thrugh enmyes comynge vpon them And then they sayd ye who someuer wolde deffende kepe them from these peryles he shold haue the ryght of noblenesse for hym his heyers for euer more in thys maner of wyse many are radde to be noble me The fourth cause of noblynesse was grete haboundaunce of goodes Somtyme the people we holde with grete penury of mete drynke And then they toke them and theyrs to some ryche man that thrugh that couenaunte they s  old tempre the grete straytnesse of ther hungre and after that they shold knowe hym as theyr lorde and a noble man Also there be founde certen noble men by the prouysyon of god thoughe they were but fewe of the whyche some abode in vertue as Dauyd and some fayled

of Englonde was fyrst named Albyon and by what encheson it was so named OF the noble londe of Sirrie there was a ryal kynge myghty a man of grete renowne that was called Dyoclesya that wel worthely hym gouerned ruled thrugh hys noble cheualry Soo that he conquered all the londes aboute hym so that almoost al the kynges of ye worlde to hym were attendaut It befell thus that this Dyoclesya spowsed a gentyl damoysell that was woder fayre that was his vncles doughter Labana she loued hym as reason wolde so that he gate vpo her xxxiii daughters of the whiche ye eldest was called A bine And these damoyselles wha they came vnto aege became so fayre that it was wonder wherof Dyoclesyan anone lete make a somonynge comaunded by his letters that all ye kynges that helde of hym sholde come at a certayne daye as in his letters were conteyned to make a feest ryall At whiche daye thyther they came brought with theym Admyralles prynces and dukes and noble chyualry The feest was ryally arayed and there they lyued in Ioye myrth ynough that it was wonder to wyte And it befell thus that Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge al tho kynges that were at that solempnyte And so they spake dyd that Albine his eldest doughter al her systers rychely were maryed vnto xxxiii kynges that were lordes of grete honour of power at this solempnyte And wha the solempnyte was doone euery kynge toke his wyfe ladde them in to theyr owne coutre there made them quenes And it befell thus afterwarde that this dame Albine became so stoute so sterne that she tolde lytell pryce of her lorde and of hym had scorne dyspyte wolde not do his wyll but she wolde haue her owne wyl in dyuers maters And al her other systers euery chone bare them so euyl agaynst theyr lordes that it was wonder to wyte And for as moche that the thought that theyr husbondes were not of so hyghe parentage come as theyr fad But those kyng that were theyr lordes wolde haue chastysen them with fayre manere vpo al loue frendshyp that they sholde amende theyr selfwylled condycyons But all was for noughte for they dyd theyr owne wyl in al thynge that the lyked had of power wherfore those xxxiii kynges vpon a tyme and ofte tymes bete theyr wyues For they we de that they wolde amende theyr tatches And theyr wyckednesse But of suche condycyons they were that for fayre speche warnynge they dyd all ye wors for betynges ofte tymes moche the wors Wherfore the kynge that had wedded Albine wrote the tatches and condycyons of his wyfe Albine and sente the lettre to Dyoclesyan his fader And whan the other kynges herde that Albines lorde hadde sente a lettre to Dyoclesyan anone they sente letters sealed with theyr seales the condycyons tatches of theyr wyues whan the kynge Dyoclesyan sawe herde so many playntes of his doughters He was sore ashamed  became wonder angry and wrothe towarde his doughters and thought howe he thene myght amende it that they so mysdyde And anone sente his letters vnto the xxxiii kynges that they sholde come to hym brynge with theym theyr wyues euerychone at a certayne daye For he wolde there chastyse theym of theyr wyckednesse yf he myght in ony maner wyse So the kynges came all at that tyme day that then was sette bytwene hym and the kynges Dyoclesyan receyued them with moche honoure and made a solempne feest to all that were vnderneth his lordshyp And the thyrde day after that solempnyte the kynge Dyoclesyan sente after his xxxiii doughters that they sholde come speke with hym in his chabre And whan they were come he spake to them of theyr wyckednes of theyr cruelte and spytefully them repreued blamed to them he sayde That yf they wolde not be chastysed they sholde his loue lose for euermore And whan the ladyes herde al this they became abasshed gretly ashamed And to theyr fader they sayde that they wolde make al amendes and so they departed out of theyr faders chabre And dame Albine that was the eldest syster ladde theym alto her chambre then made to voyde all that were therin so that no persone was amonge theym but she and her systers togyder Then sayd Albine My fayre systers wel we know that ye kynge our fader vs hath reproued shame and dyspysed for bycause to make vs obedyen  vnto our husbondes But certes that shall I neuer whyles that I lyue sythe that I am come of a more hygher kyng bloode than myn husbonde And whan she had thus sayde alle her

is that this nyghte whan our husbondes ben a bede all we with one assente for to kytte theyr throtes and thenne we may be in peas of them And beter we now do this thynge vnder our faders power than other where elles And anone all the ladyes consented and graunted to this counsell And whan nyght was comen the lordes and ladyes went to bedde And anone as theyr lordes were a slepe they kette all theyr husbo des throtes and so they slewe them all whan that Dyoclesyan theyr fader herd of this thinge he became furyously wrothe agaynste hys doughters And anone wolde them alle haue brente But all the barons and lordes of Sirrie couseyled not so for to do suche streytnesse to his owne doughters but only sholde voyde the londe of them for euer more so that they neuer sholde come ayen and so he dyde And Dyoclesyan that was theyr fader anone comaunded them to go in to a shyppe deliuered to the vytaylles for half a yere And whan this was done all the systers went in to the shyppe and saylled forthe in the see betoke all theyr frendes to Apolin that was theyr god And so long they saylled in the see tyll at the last they came and arryued in an yle that was all wyldernesse And whan dame Albion was come to that londe all her systers This Albyne went fyrste forth out of the shyppe sayd to her other systers For as moche sayde she as I am the eldest syster of all this company fyrst this

were dyspended they fayled they fedde them with herbes and fruites in the season of the yere and so they lyued as they best myghte And after that they toke flesshe of dyuerse beestes became wonder fatte And so they desyred mannes company and mannes kynde that the fayled And for hete they waxed wo der courageous of kynde so that they desyred more manes company than ony other solace and myrthe wha the deuyll that perceyued we te by dyuerse countrees and toke a body of ye ayre lykynge natures shed of men cam in to the londe of Albyon laye by tho wymen shadde tho natures vpon them they

in Albyon And they dwelled in caues and in hylles atte ther wylle And hadde the londe of Albyon as them lykyd vnto ye tyme that Brute arryued and came to Tornes that was in the yle of Albyon And there this Brute coquered and dyscomfyted the gyauntes abouesayde Explicit prima pars Here begynneth now how Brute was goten how he slewe first his moder after his fader And how he conquered Albyon that after he named Brytayne after his owne name that now is callyd Englonde after ye name of Engyst of Saxonie This Brute came in to Brytayne aboute the xviii yere of Hely BE it knowen that in the noble cytee of grete Troy there was a noble knyght a man of grete power that was called Eneas And whan the cyte of Troy was loste destroyed thrugh them of Grece Thys Eneas wyth all his meyne fledde thes came to Lombardy That the was lorde gouernoure of ye londe a kyng that was called Latyne And an other kynge there was that was called Turocelyne that strongely warred vpon this kynge Latyne that oftentymes dyde hym moche harme And wha this kynge Latyne herde that Eneas was come he receyued hym with moche honour him with helde for as moche as he had herde of hym wyst wel that he was a noble knyght a worthy of hys body of his dedes This Eneas helped kyng Latyne i his warre And shortely for to telle so well and so worthely he dyde that he slewe Turocelyne and discomfyted hym and all his people And whan all this was done kynge Latyne gaaf all that londe that was Turocelynes to thys noble man Eneas in maryage wyth Lauyne his doughter ye moost fayrest creatue that ony man wyst And so they lyued togyder in yoy  myrthe all the dayes of ther lyftyme And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyf vpon her he gate a sone that was called Silueyne And this Silueyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwetynge his fader and aenst his wyll aqueyted hym with a damoysell that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter ye quene that was Eneas wyf and brought the damaysell with chylde And whan Ascanius his fader it wyst anone lete enqueyre of ye wysest maysters of ye grettest clerkes what chylde the domoysell sholde brynge forth they answerde sayd that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shalde kylle bothe his fader also his moder And so he dyde For his moder deyed in berynge of hym And whan this childe was borne his fader lete calle hi Brute And the maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme sorowe in many dyuers places and after he sholde come to grete honour and worshyp This kyng Ascanius deyed whan god wolde and Silueyne his sone receyued the londe made hym wonderly well beloued amonge his people And so wha Brute that was Silueynes sone was xv yere olde he wente vpon a day with his fader for to play solace And as Brute sholde haue shot vnto an herte his arowe myshappe and gla ced and so there Brute slewe hys fader How Brute was dreuen out of the londe and how he helde hym in Grece ANd whan this myschauce was befall all ye people of the londe made sorowe ynough were sore an angred And for enche son there of they droue brute out of the lode wolde not suffre hym among them And wha he sawe that he myght not there abyde he we from thens in to Grece and there he founde vii thousande men that were of the lygnage and kynred of Troy that were come of grete blood as the story telleth as of men and wymmen and chyldern the whyche were all hollde in thraldome and bondage of the kynge Pandras of Grece for the dethe of Achilles that was betrayed and slayne at troy This brute was a wonder fayre man and a stronge and a huge of his age and of gladde there and semblaunt and also worthy of body was well beloued amonge his people Thys kyng Pandras herde speke of his goodnes his condicions and anone made hym dwelle wyth hym soo that brute became wonder preuy moche beloued with the kynge soo that longe tyme brute dwelled with the kynge So at the laste they of Troy and brute spake togyders of kynred and of lygnage of acquayntaunce there playned them vnto Brute of ther sorowe of ther bondage of many other shames that the kynge Pandras had them done And vnto brute they sayde vpon a tyme ye be a lorde of our lygnage a strong man a myghty  ye be our capytayne lorde and gouernoure we wyll become your men your comaundeme tes doo in all maner of thynges brynge vs out of this wretchednesse and bondage we wyll fyghte with the kynge for trouthe with ye grace of the grete god we shal hym ouercome and we shall make you kyng of the londe and to you doo homage and of you we shall holde euer more Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bodage that they were brought i And preu  ly wente then from the kynges courte and tho them that were of Troy wente and put them in to woodes and in to moutaynes and them there helde And sente vnto kynge Pandras that he sholde gyue them leue sauely for to we de out of the londe for they wolde noo l  nger dwelle in his bondage The kynge Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed and tho swore that he sholde slee them euerychone and ordeyned a grete power and wente to warde them all for to fyght But Brute and his men maly them defended and fyerfly fought and slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped and toke the kynge and helde hym in pryson and ordeyned counsell bytwen them what they myghte done And some sayde that he sholde be put to dethe and some sayde that he sholde be exiled out of ye londe And some sayd that he sholde be brete And tho spake a wyse kynght that was called Mempris and sayd to Brute and to alle tho of Troy yf kynge Pandras wolde yelde hym and haue his lyf I counsell that he gyue vnto Brute that is our duke our souerayne his doughter Gennogen to a wyf and in maryage wyth her an hodred shyppes well arayed and all his tresoure of golde syluer of corne of wyne as moche as we nede to haue of  o thyng other thene go we out of this londe ordeyned vs a londe elles where For we nenoe of our kynred that come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe amoge theym of Grece For we haue slayne so many of ther knyghtes and of other fredes that euer more warre and contake sholde be among vs Brute tho and all his folke consented well to that counseyll And this thynge they tolde to kyng Padras And he for to haue his lyf grau ted as moche as they axed and anone gaf vnto Brute Gennogen his doughter to wyfe an hondred shyppes with asmoche as them neded of all vytaylles as afore was ordeyned Brute tho toke his wyfe and all his men that forsoke the londe of Grece and went them vnto the see and had wynde weder at theyr wyll and came ye thyrde daye in to an Ile that was called Lorgers Thys Brute anone sente of his men a londe for to espye the maner of the countree And they founde an olde cyte all wasted and forlet that was ther in nother ma ne woman ne no thynge dwellynge and in the mydeell of this cyte they founde an olde temple of a fayre lady that was called Dyana the goddesse And they came ayen vnto Brute tolde hym what they had seen and foude And they counselled hym to goo and doo sacrefyce vnto dame Dyana for she was wote to yeue answere of what euer men prayed her and namely vnto them that her honoured with sacrefyce Brute wente vnto that yamge and sayd Dyana noble goddesse that all thynge haste in thy myght and power wyndes waters woodes felde and all thynge of the world and all manere of beestes that theryn ben To you I make my prayer that ye me counseyll and telle where and in what place I shall haue a couenable dwellynge for me and for my people and there I shal make in honour of you a well fayre temple and a noble wherin ye shall alwaye be honoured wha he had done his prayer Dyana answerd in this maner Brute sayde she go euen forth thy waye ouer the see in io Frauce to warde the west and there ye shall fynde an yle that is called Albyon that yle is be compassed all wyth the see and noo man maye come ther in but it be by shyppes and in that londe were wonte to dwelle gyauntes but now it is not soo but all wyldernes And that londe is destenyed and ordeyned for you and for your people How Corin became Brutes man and how kynge Goffar was dyscomfyted THenne whan Brute had this answere of Dyana the goddes Anone he lete ye ancres wynde vp sayled in to the hyghe see And whan he his men had saylled xx dayes and moo they foude fast besyed a cost of ye see a thousande men of the lygnage kynred of Troy And ther souerayne ther mayster of all was called Corin And whan Brute wyste whens they were he tho toke them wyth moche Ioye in to hys shyppes and ladde theym forth wiht hym Th Corin there be came brutes man to hym dyde homage And so longe they saylled forth in the see tyll they cam vnto Gascoyne And anone they arryued in the hauen of Lyegers there they dwlled viii dayes them for to rest ther saylles to amede there that it was nede Tydynges soone came to kynge Goffar that was lorde of that lode howe that moche people of strauge londe were arryued in to his lode in ye hauen of Lyegres wherfore he was sore angreged anoyed that they came and arryued in his londe wythout his lycence and his leue And anone ordened hym a gret power for to dryue out brute to destroye hym all his people But it was so that kyng Goffar was dyscomfyted all his peple And hym self fledde in to Frauce there for helpe socour And in that tyme regned in Fraunce xii kynges an xi of them assembled a grete power for to helpe Goffar for to fight ayest Brute This Goffar dwelled with the of frau ce halfe a yere more And in the meane tyme whan Goffar was in Frauce Brute and his company destroyed all the londe of Gascoyne and lete take all the tresour that kyng Goffar had there lete brynge it all in to his shyppes And this Brute founde in that londe a fayry place and couenable there brute made a fayre castel and a stronge whan that this was done kyng Goffar came from Fraunce and xi kynges with hym and brought wyth hym xxM men for to fyghte with Brute and his company and Brute had but viiM CCC men And neuertheles whanne the two hostes mette togyder Brute folke thorugh helpe of hymself of Turin his cosen and of Corin ye well and manly hym defended and fought so tyll that in lytell tyme they hadde slayne of the Frensshemen two thousande mo Anone all that were alyue fledde awaye And in this bataylle Turin Brutes cosyn was slayne And Brute lete entere hym worthely whan he had space leyser in the castell that he had made tho lete calle that same castell Toures For by cause of the name of Turin that there was entred And yet vnto this day there is a noble cyte that is called Toures And kynge Goffar wyste that Turin was deed he came agayne with his men after yaue a stronge bataylle vnto Brute But brute his men were so wery for fyghtynge that they myght noo lenger endure but to megre hym all his And then Brute yede in to his castell with his men and made the gates faste for to saue them and for to take counsell amoage them what were best for to do Brute and Corin gaaf counsell and ordeyned pryuely that Corin sholde go oute busshe him i a wood tyll on the morne soo that in the mornynge whan that Brute sholde fyghte with his enemyes thenne Corin shold come with his folke in the one syde and slee and do all the harme that he myght And in a mornynge in the dawnynge of the daye Brute we te out of the castell and fyersely faughte with his enmyes and they manly deffended them But within a lytell tyme Brute and his folke slewe viii hondred of kynge Goffars men Thenne came Corin with ye busshement and smote to grounde he his companye all those that wolde stonde or abyde So that the kyng Goffar his copany were dyscofyted faste they began to flee And brute Corin with ther copany fyersely them pursewed slewe mo of them in ye fleynge than they dyd in ye batayll And i this maner Brute had the victory and neuertheles brute made moche sorowe for his cosyn Turi that there was slayne other also that he haded lost of his men That is to saye vii hondred and xv The whiche nobly he entered in the same castell of Toures there where he had entered Turin his cosyn How Brute arryued at Totnesse in the yle thenne called Albyon and of the bataylle that was betwixt Corin and Gogmagog SO whan all this was done Brute wolde no lenger there dwell for to fyghte nor for to lese no moo of his people For kynge Goffars people myghte euery daye encreace mo and moo And Brutes lossened And therfore he toke all his men and wente vnto the see and had wende and weder at theyr wyll And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Totnesse and came in to the yle of Albyon And there neyther man nor woman as the story telleth they founde but Gyautes And they dwelled in hylles in caues And Brute sawe the londe was fayre and at his lykynge And was good also for hym and for his people as Dyan a the goddesse hadde hym behyght And therfore was Brute wonder gladde and lette assembled vpon a daye all his  ol  e to make a solempne sacrefyce and a grete feest in honour reuerence of Dyana the goddesse of the whiche he hadde counseyll fyrste for to come in to this londe And thenne whan that they hadde ther solempnyte done as they vpon a daye sate at ther meete there came in vpon them xxx gyauntes slewe of Brutes men

londe Mordred myghte not ayenst them endure But anone was dyscomfyted flydde thens the same nyght with his men vpon the morne came to London But tho of the cyte wolde not suffre hym to come in And from thens he fledde to wynchestre and there he hym helde with his people yt came with him Kynge Arthur lete take the body of Gawyne his cofyn the body of Anguysshell and lete ye one be borne in to

there lyue and neuer after was seen amonges the folke her lyf duryng Kynge Arthur wyst that Mordred was fledde in to Cornewayle lete sende after his men in to Scotlonde and Northomberlonde vnto Humbre and lete assemble folke without nombre and came fro thens in to Cornewayle to seke and pursewe after Mordred And Mordred had assembled to hym all the folke of Cornewayle and had people without nombre  wyst that Arthur was comynge and had leuer to deye and take his chauce than longer flee abode and yaue an harde batayll to kynge Arthur to his people so that moche people was slayne what of one syde

and also the noble knyghtes of the rounde table that so moche were praysed thorugh oute all the worlde were there slayne kynge Arthur hymself was wounded vnto dethe But he lete hym to be borne to

that his deth shall be doubtous and sayde sothe For therof yet men haue doubte and shall haue for euer more as men saye For me wote not wyther that he is on lyue or deed Arthur was borne at Auioun the xxii yere of his regne after the Incarnacyon of our lorde Ihesu Cryste vCxlvi yere How kynge Arthur delyuered the reame vnto Constantyne the sone of Cador his neuewe AS kynge Arthur wyste that he myght noo lenger regne he lette come before hym Constantyne yt was Cadors sone Erle of Cornewayle his cosyn to hym betoke all his reame toke him sayd bad hym therof to be kynge tyll that he came ayen for as moche as he had none heeyre of hys body begoten And grete damage was it that soo noble a kynge and soo doughty as he was hadde noo chylde of his body begoten But all thynge that god woll haue done must be done whose name be blessyd wythout ende How kynge Constantyne was vexed of Mordred two sones THis Constantyne was a noble knyght and a worthy of body And tho two sones that Mordred had begoten had grete enuy of Constatyne that tho was crowned kynge And so it befell yt they meued warre ayenst hym And assembled a grete host of them that were before with Mordred had ben dryuen a waye that dyd moche sarowe anguysshe thrughout all that londe That one brother ordeyned purposed hym towarde the auncyent Cyte of London for to take ye cyte And that other went to wynchestre But Constantyne came to Lodon slewe hym yt was there And after he went to wychestre slewe hym yt was there also So yt bothe his enmyes were deed And whan Constantyne had regned well worthely four yere he deyed lyeth at Lodon Of the kynges Adelbryght of Edell AFter kynge Constantynes dethe there were two kynges in Brytayne ye one was called Adelbryght yt was a danoys And he helde the coutree of Norfolke Southfolke That other hyght Edell was a Bryton and helde Nicholl Lendeser and all the londe vnto Humbre These two kynges faste warred togyder but after accorded they were and loued togyder as they had ben borne of oo body The kynge Edell had a suster that was called Orewenne And he gaf her thrught grete freodshyp to kyng Adelbryght to wyf And he begate vpon her a doughter that was called Argentyll And in the thyrde yere after came vpon hym a strange sykenesse that nedes he must deye And he sente to kynge Edell hys broder in lawe that he sholde come and speke wyth hym and he came to hym wyth a good wyll Tho prayed he the kynge and coniured hym also in the name of god That after whan he were deed he sholde take hys doughter Argentyll and the londe and that he kepte her welle and nourysshe her in hys chambre And whan she were of aege she sholde be maryed to the strongest and worthyest man that he myghte fynde and thenne he sholde yelde vp her londe ayen Edell it graunted and by othe confermed hys prayer And whan Adelbryght was deed and enteryd Edell tooke the damoysell Argentyll and nourrsshed her in hys chambre and she became as fayre as ony myghte be How kynge Edell maryed that damoysell to a knaue of his kechyne THis kyng Edell that was vncle to Argentyll be thought how that he myght falsely haue the londe fro his nyce for euer more and falsely aynst hys othe thought to dysceyue ye damoysell and to marye her to a knaue of his kechyne that was called Curan and he became ye worthyest and strongest man of body that ony man wyst in ony londe that tho lyued and to hym he thought her shamfully haue maryed for to haue had her londe afterwarde but he was clene dysceyued For thys Curan was Hauelockis sone that was kynge of Kyrkelane in Denmarke and this Curan conquered hys wyues londe after warde and slewe kyng Edel that was h  wyues vncle and had al her londe as in an other place it telleth more openly he regned but iii yere for Saxons Danes hi slewe that was grete harme to all Brytayn Srytons bare hym to Sto  henge and entyred hym honourably Of kyng Conan that was Curans cosyn AFter this Curan regned his cosyn Conan that was a wonder proude knyghte And regned and coude haue noo maner of loue but euer he was medlynge wyth hys people And tooke his vncle with warre and slewe his two chyldern The Saxons warred ayenst hym oftentymes but he them ouer came and soo he was in peas all his lyf tyme And he regned xiiii yere And after he deyed and lyeth at London Of kynge Cortyf of Gurmonde that came thorugh the paynems in to Brytayne AFter this Conan regned his cosyn cortyf that was behated of all his peple no thynge beloued this Cortyf lost all Brytayne thrugh warre And i his tyme fell ye grete myscheyf in Brytayn ye crystendom was destroyed all ye Brytons were dryue out of the londe and the londe lost with out ony recouer But after warde left the londe to the Saxons as ye afterwarde shall here For in that tyme there was a paynem that was called Gormo de that was the kynges sone Daufrices of the panems folke that hadde the reame after hys fader was kynge sauf he bequaue yaue it to his broder And sayd that he wolde neuer be kynge but yf that he myght gete and conquere a reame in a straunge countree For he was bolde stronge of body And of hym prophecyed Merlyn sayde that hesholde be a wulf of the see And he lette assemble paynems wythout nombre lete appareylle shyppes wente by many londes toke homages feautees of many And so he wente by the see conquered many dyuerse londes So that he came in to Irlonde conquered that lond that often tymes warred vpon Brytons and Brytons vpon them oft wonne oft lost yaue hostages to Brytons And so they sent to Gurmonde there that he was in Irlonde that he shold come in to Brytayne and helpe them ayenst ye Brytons to helpe them to delyuer that londe of them they wolde hym holde gladly for theyr lord For he was a paynem and they were paynems the Brytons were crystened well ought he them for to helpe so as they were all of one lawe wha Gurmonde herde this prayer he hasted him as moche as he myght arryued in Scotlonde came in to Northomberlonde there that the Saxons were dwellynge and they confermed the couenautes bytwene them that were made by othes by hostages for to bere hym true fay holde hym for lorde and paye to hym truage by the yere Tho began the Saxons and ye Affricans to destroye robbe and brenne townes destroye all theng  in asmoche as they myght spared neyther man woman ne chylde lerned ne lewde But all they slewe caste downe townes castels chirches so put they all the londe in grete destruccyon And as soone as they myghte flee they fledde thens as well poore as ryche bysshops abbottes chanons all other grete smal some in to lytell Brytayne some in to Cornewayle all tho ye shyppes myghht haue How the kynge Gurmonde droue kyng Cortyf to Chechestre slewe the Brytons thrugh crafte engyne gate the same towne COrtyf the kyng fledde thens in to Chechestre that tho was stronge and there helde hym xx dayes this Gurmonde came and it besyeged But the cytee was so stronge that he myght not gete it by no maner of wyse with engyne that they myght doo Tho bethought they vpon a subtylte for to brenne the towne They made engynes wyth glewe of nettes toke pecys of thunder of fyre bonde it to sparowes feet than lete them flee and they anoe flewe lodged the in ye towne ther yt theyr nestis were in stackes euesynges of houses ye fyre began to kyndle brente all ye towne And whan the Brytons sawe that in euery syde they hyed them out fought but anone they were slayne and dyscomfyted And whyle batayll dured the kynge pryuely hydde hym and stale awaye in to walys men wyst neuer where he became and soo was the towne of Chechestre taken and destroyed And after Gurmonde wente and destroyed townes and cytees that neuer were after made ayen as it is seen yet in many places of thys londe How thys londe was called Englonde for the name of Engyst how many kynges were made after in thys londe SO whan Gurmonde had destroyed al the londe thrugh out he yaue the londe to the Saxons anone they toke it with good wyll for the Saxons longe tyme had desyred it For asmoche as they wereof Engist kynred that fyrst had all the londe of Brytayne lete them be called Englyssmen for by cause of Engistes name the lond they lete call Englonde in theyr langage the folke ben called Englyshmen for asmoche as in thys tyme it was called Engist londe whan he had coquered it of Vortiger that spoused hys doughter But fro the tyme yt Brute came fyrst in to Englonde thys londe was called Brytane and the folke Brytons But syth the tyme yt thys Gurmonde conquered it eftsones and yaue it vnto the Saxons they anone ryght chauged the name as before is sayde And whan thys was done Gurmonde passed ouer in to Frau ce there conquered many londes destroyed all cristen peple there that he came And the Saxons dwelled in this londe and began fast to enhabyte it at ther owne wyll And they wolde haue made newe kyngis lordes but they myght neuer assent to haue only oo kynge for to be to them attendaunt therfore they made many kynges in dyuerse shyres as it was in Engistes tyme The fyrste kyngdome was Kente that othe Southsexe and the thyrde westsex the fourth Eestsex the fyfth Nothu berlonde and ye sixth Estangle that is to saye Northfolke and Southfolke and the seuenth Mercheryche and that is the Erldoste of Nycholl Hutyngdon Herforde Gloucetre wynlchestre wer wyke Derby and so departed all Englond in to vii partyes And after that it befell that tho kyng warred oft tymes togyder And euer he that was strongest toke hym that was feblest and soo it was longe tyme yt they had noo kynge crowned amonge theym ne no crysten man was tho amonge them ne crystendome nather But were paynems tyll that saynt Gregory was pope of Rome that had seen childern of the nacyon of Englonde in the cyte of Rome that were wonder fayre creatures had grete wyll and desyre theym to beholde And axed of ye marchautes whens they were and of what nacyon And men tolde hym that they were of Englonde and Inglysshe they were called but they all the people of Englonde were paynems and byleued not vpon god Alas sayde saynt Gregory well maye they be called Englysshe for they haue the vysages of angels and therfore well ought they to be crystened And for this cause saynt Gregory theresente saynt Austyn in to Englode xl good me with hym that were of good lyf holy men to preche teche to comuetre the Englysshe people them to torne to god that was in the vi yere that saynt Gregory had be pope of Rome that is to saye ofter thyn carnacyon of our lorde Ihesu Cryste vClxxxv yeres as the Cronycle telleth How saynt Austyn baptysed and conuerted kynge Adelbryght and the bysshoppes that he made his felowes AS saynt Austyn came fyrste in to Englonde he arryuen in the yle of Tenet and so passed forth came vnto Caunterbury and there soyourned And kynge Adelbryght of Kent that was the lygnage of Engist goodly receyued saynt Austyn hys felowes wyth moche honour and them foude all that them neded And more ouer he yaue theym a fayre place that now is called the abbay of Shynt Austyn in whiche place he lyth hym self shryned This kynge Adelbryght was a good man wyth good wylle herde saynt Austyns predycacyons and yaue hym leue to preche thrughout all hys londe before sayd of Kente to torne and conuerte to hym all ye people that he myght It befelle soo after thorugh goddes grace that in lytell tyme the kynge hymself was conuerted to god and all hys peop of his londe were baptysed And in the meane whyle the peple torned them to god Saynt Austyn came to Rochestre there he preched the worde of god And the paynems therfore hym scorned and caste vpon hym reygh taylles so that all his mantell was hanged full of these reygh tayles and for more dyspyte they caste vpon hym the guttes of reyghes other fysshe wherfore the good man Saynt Austyn was sore anoyed and greued And prayed to god that all tho chyldern of that cyte that sholde be borne after warde that is for to saye in the of Rochestre myght haue taylles and soo they hadde And whan the kynger herde of this vengeaunce that was falle thrugh saynt Austyns prayer He lete make an house in the honour of almyghty god wherin wymmen sholde be delyuered of theyr childern at the bryges ende In the whiche hous yet wymmen of the cyte ben delyuerde of chylde whan that saynt Gregory hadde hrede tell how the Englysshe people were torned to god comuerted he sente vnto saynt Austyn his pallyon by a b  sshop that was called Paulin and made hym Prymate Archebysshop of Englonde And sente worde that he sholde ordeyne make dysposynge the londe And anone Austyn had the pallyon of the dygnyte of the Archebysshyp He made two bysshops of his felowes that came with hym fro Rome one was called Mellite he dwelled at London that other was called Iustin that helde the dygnyte at Rochestre And this bysshop Mellite tho went to preche in to Estsex and erystened the kynge of the countree that was called Sicwith that was kynge Adlebrytes cosyn hys systers sone Thys Iustyn wente to preche in Southse  and torned moche of the people to god And Saynt Austyn hymselfe preched thorugh out Englonde How saynt Austyn wente in to waels there the Brytons were how they wolde not beobedyent tothe Archebysshop of Cauterbury SO whan all Englonde was crystened and torned to god saynt Astuyn went in to that londe there that the Brytons were for to kepe them frome Englysshmen that is to saye in to ways And there he founde monkes abbayes and vii bysshops For ye Brytons alwaye destroyed the crysten people that saynt Austyn had conuerted And he sayde to the bysshops that he was a Legate of Rome Prymate of all Englonde that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyenc they sayde they nolde but to the Archebysshop of Carlyon they wolde They wolde neuer for noo maner thynge be obedyent to the Englysshe men For the Englysshemen they sayde ben our aduersaryes our enmyes haue dryuen vs out of our countree weben crysten men euer haue be And the Englysshemen haue euer be paynems but now of late that they ben conuerted Saynt Austyn of them myght haue none answere otherwyse but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer them meke to hym ne to the pope of Rome And saynt Austyn torned ayen tho to kynge Adelbryght yt was kynge of Kent and tolde hym that hys folke wolde not be to no man obedyent but to the Archebysshop of Carlyon And whan the kynge herde thys he was sore anoyed sayd that he wolde them destroye and sent to Elfryde kynge of Northunberlonde that was hys frende that he sholde come to hym with al the power that he myght and that he wolde mete hym at Leycetre and fro thens they wolde go in to walys and there destroye the Archebysshop of Carlyon and all tho that had refused saynt Austyn How kynge Adelbryght and the kynge Elfryde slewe Brecinall that was a kynge of Brytons that helde the countree of Leycetre IT be tell soo that there was a kynge of Brytons that helde the countree of Leycetre and alle the countree aboute hys name was Brecinall And this Bryton herde telle that tho two Englysshe kynges wolde mete there at Leycetre for to goo in to walys He lete ordeyne all the power that he had for to goo fyght with these two kynges but lytel it auayled hym for his folke that he had were slayne and hymself fledde loste his londes for euer more And these two kynges Adelbryght Elfryde dwelled a whyle at Leycetre and departed the londe amonge them and tooke homag and feautees of the

amonge them good men and hooly of hemytes monkes and preestes of other people grete plentye that wente bare foote and wulwarde for ta haue mercy of thes two kynges but tho kynges were so sterne so wyked yt they wold neuer speke to the but them slewe euerychone Alas for sorowe for they ne spared them noomore than the wulfe dothe the shepe but smot of theyr heedes euerychone so they were all martrd that to them came that is to vnderstande vC xl After they wente fro thens to Bangor for to slee all those that ther myghte there fynde of the Brytons And whan ye Brytouns herde that they assembled and ordened all ther power for to fyght with thyem Two was there a baron in walys that was called Bledrik of Cornewayle that some tyme was lorde of Deuenshyre but the kynge Adelbright had dreuen hym out in to walys and after there he yaue them batayll And at that batayll was kynge Adelbright slayne and Efrydesore wouded forsoke the felde the moost partye of his people slayne And Elfryde flede in to Northumberlonde that was his owne lo de And after that the people of Leycetre shyre made with strenght Cadewan yt was Brycinals sone kynge of Leceytre And he afterregned nobly and with grete honour How Cade wan kynge of Leycetre Elfryde kynge of Northumberlonde were frendes of the debate yt after was bytwene Edwyn Cad walyn that were both theyr sones ANd after that thys bataylle was done yt Brytons assembled them and wente thens and came to Leycetre and made there Caudewan that was Brecinals sone kynge of Leycetre and of all the countree Aed he toke homages feautes of all the folke of the countree And after that he assembled a grete hoste and sayde he wolde goo in to Northumberlonde to destroy kynge Elfryde and sle hym yf he myght And whan he was come thether frendes wente so bytwene them that they accorde them in this manere that Elfryde sholde holde all the londe fro Northumberlonde to Scotlonde And Cadewan sholde haue all the londe a thys syde Humbre to the Southe and after they were good frendes all theyr lyf and loued as they had ben brethern And thys Elryde had a sone called Edwyn that helde all  the londe of Northuberlonde after his fathers dethe as his fader hadde holde all his lyf tyme And Cadewa had another sone called Cadwalyn that helde his faders londe as he it helde whyle he was alyue and these loued as bretheren And ye loue lasted betwyxt them but only two yere after began debat betwyxt them throughe a synple enuyous cosyn of Cadwalins called Bryens so yt they assembled a grete hoste in bothe partyes And at the laste it be fell ye Cadwalin was dyscuforted Edwen hym pursued droue hym fro place to place so at the last he fledde in to Irelonde And ye other destroyd pylled his londe and cast downe castels brente his maners departed all Cadwalins londe amonge his frendes And longe tyme after came Cadwalen ayen fro Irlonde with a stronge pour and in playne batayll slewe Edwyn all his frendes namely tho yt with helde his

cadwalyn warred vpon hym droue hym to warde Scotlond And whan Cadwalin sawe that he wolde not abyde Cadwalin wolde no lenger hym pursue but toke some of his folke to Peanda his broder in lawe prayed hym to pursue after Oswalde tyl that he were take slayne and Cadwalin toruned home ayen whan Oswalde herde these tydynges that Cadwalin tourned home ayen he wolde no le ger flee but abode Peanda yaue

a grete hoste for to fyght with Oswalde soo that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde yaue batayll vnto Oswalde And in the same batayll was Oswalde slayne his heed smyten of after he was entered at the abbay of Berdenay in whiche place god hadde wrought for hym many a fayre myracle bothe there and elles where And anone Oswy his brother seased all the londe in to his honde that was this Oswaldis And the folke of Northumberlonde loued him wonderly well and helde hym for theyr lorde But he had men of his kynne worthy ynough that wolde haue departed the londe and they warred togyed well And for asmoche as they were not stronge ynoughe they came to Peanda and prayed hym of helpe socour And behyght hym of ye lode largely vpo this couenat that he wold them gouerne helpe counseyl Peanda herde theyr prayer so spake with Cadwalyn that he sholde ordayne a grete host and faste ordeyned hym in to Northumberlonde for teyght with Oswy And Oswy was a meke man moche loued peas charyte and prayed Peanda of loue peas and profe  ede hym of golde and syluer grete plentye And this Peanda was so proude yt he nolde graunt hym peas fo no maner thynge but for all thynge he wolde with hym fyght S  o at

thenne was there a greate dyscorde bytwene the lordes of the londe that euery of them warred vpon other And yet in that tyme there fell so grete derth scarsyte of corn other viteylles in this londe

that Buernes frendes hadde those helde hym for kynge a man that was called Elle for as moche as they wolde not to kynge Osbryght be attendant for the despyte that he had done vnto Buerne theyr cosyn It befell thus that the kyng Elle was gone in to the wood hym for to dyosporte of the venyson some he had taken And as he sate in the wood at meete to a knyght he sayde we ha  wel spedde and moche

stode euer fought and well worthyly hym defended as a noble baron But at the last he was sore woundyd in his heed And syr Wyllyam of Sullaynde syr Roger of Benfeelde were slayne at that batayll whan

after the time that kyng Edwarde was take he was put into warde tyll that the Spensers were put to deth and also bycause that he wolde not come vnto his parlement at London as he had ordeyned and assygned hymselfe vnto hys baronage and also wolde not gouerne and rule his people ne his reame as a kynge sholde doo Wherfore some of the barons of Englonde came and yelde vp ther homages vnto hym

other halfe it was founde by an enquest of the cytye that the Englysshmen began the debate How the Englysshme stoppyd the Scottes in the parke of Stanope and howe they torned ayen into Scotlonde THys tyme the Scottes had assembled all theyr power came into Englonde slewe robbyd all yt they myght take brent dystroyed all the North coutree thrugh out tyll that they came vnto the parke of S  ahope in weridale there ye Scottes helde theym in a bussment but wha ye kyng had harde thorou spyes where ye Scottes were anone ryght hoste desegyd them within the forsayd parke so that ye scottes wyst not

vnto thys tyme there was neuer seen so fayre an hoste what of Englysshmen of alyaces of men of fote the whyche ordeyned theym for to fyght wyth ye Scottes thrugh eggynge of syr Henry of Lancastre of

hastely to the erle of Lancastre to syr Iohn of Henaude yt they sholde not fyght with the Scottes in preiudyce and harmynge of hym his fee yf they dyde that they sholde stonde to theyr owne paryll And the forsayd erle Marshall was all arayed with his batayll att the reredoos of the erle of Lancastre for to haue fought with hym with his folke yf he had go to fyght wyth the Scottes in thys manere he was deceyued wyste no thynge of the treason And thus was the kyng pryncypally dysceyued And whan it was nyghte Mortymer yt had the watche for to kepe of ye host that nyght distrobled ye watche yt noo thynge myght be done And in the meane whyle the Scottes stele by nyght to ward theyr owne coutre as fast as they myght And so was the kyng fasly betrayed that wenyd that alle ye traytours of londe had ben brought to an ende as it was sayd before Now here you lordes how tratoursly kyng Edwarde was dysceyued how meruayllously boldly the scottes dyde of werre For Iames douglas wyth two hudred men of

in greto peryll was tho the reame of Englonde and that nyghte the mone shone full clere and bryghte And for all the kynges men the Scottes scapyd harmeles And oon the morowe whan the kynge wyste that the Scottes were escapyd in to theyr owne coutree he was wonder sory and fulle hertely wepte wyth hys yonge eyne and yet wyste he not who hadde hym doone that treason But that fals treasone was fulle welle I knowen a good whyle after as the storye makyth mencyon Tho kynge Edward came ayen vnto yorke full sorowfull And hys host departyd and euery man wente in to his owne countree wyth full heuy chere mornynge semblaunt And the Henaudes toke theyr leue and went in to theyr owne countree And the kynge for theyr trauayll hugely rewarde them And for bycause of that vyage the kynge had dyspended moche of his tresoure and wastyd And in that tyme were seen two moones in the fyrmament ye one was clere that other was derke as men myghte see thrugh the worlde And a grete debate was that same tyme agaynst pope Iohan the xxii after saynt Petyr the emperour of Almayn tho made hym emperour ayenst ye popys wyll that tho helde hys see at Auinyon werfore the emperour made hys crye at Rome ordeyned a

the whiche castell the kynge hatyd as ony dethe And they kept hym there tylle it came vnto saynt Mathewes daye in Septembre in the yere of grace MCCCxxvii that the forsayde syr Roger Mortymer sent the

at that parlement ye kyng thrughe hys cousell none other of ye londe within aege grauntyd to be accordyd with ye scottes in this manere that all ye f  autees homages that ye scottes sholde do to the

wonder moche ye fayer daoysell dysperagyd syth that she was maryed ayenst al the comyns wyl and assent of Englonde And frome the tyme that Brute had conquered Albyon named the londe after his owne

make peas for the cowardly peas yt tho was ordeyned But ye kynges persone bare all the wyte and blame wyth wronge of makynge of the accorde And alle was done thrugh the quene Roger Mortymer And it was not longe after that the quene Isabell ne toke in to her hond all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoste all the londes that were of ony value that apperteyned to the crowne of Englonde Soo the kynge had not to dyspendede but of hys vses and of hys escheker For the quene Isabell the Mortymer hadde grete mayne of the retenewe yt folowed ye kynges courte euer more went and toke the kynges pryces for her

somoche louyd her before whan she came ayen for to pursue ye fals traytours ye Spensers fro Fraunce And in that same tyme the fals traytour Roberte of Holonde that bytrayed hys lorde syr Thomas of

for drede of the quene For the quene loued hym wonder moche And prayed vnto the kyng for hym that ye same Thomas might be exyled out of Englonde And the noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had often tymes herde the comyn claymore of ye Enghysshmen of ye dysease that were doon in Englond also for dyuers wro ges that were done to the comyn people of the whyche the kyng bare the blame with wronge For he was but fulle yonge tender of aege thought as a good man for to do awaye slake the sklauder of ye kynges persone yf that he myght in ony manere a wyse so as the kynge was therof nothynge gylty wherfore he was inperyll of lyf lymme And so he assebled all his retenuwe wente spake with them of the kynges honoure and also for to amende his estate And syr Thomas Brotherton erle of Marchall and syr Edmond wodstok that were the kynges vncles and also men of London made theyr othe hym fo to mayntene in ye same quarell And theyr cause was this that the kynge sholde holde his house and hys meyne as a kyng ought for to do and haue all his ryalt  e And that the quene Isabell sholde delyuer out of her hondes in to the kynges honde alle manere of lordshyps rentys townes and castels that apperteyneth vnto the crowne of Englonde as other quenes haue done here before and medle with none other thynge And also that syr Roger Mortymer sholde abyde and dwelle vpon his own  londes For moche people In so moche that the comyn people were dystroyed and gretely domaged thoroughe suche wrongfulle takynge And also the enquere howe and by whome that the kynge was betrayed and falsly dysceyued att Stanhope and thrughe whose counseyll that the Scottes went awaye by nyght from the kynge And also how and thrugh whoos counseyll the ordynauce that were made at the kynges coronacyon was put downe That is to saye that the kynge for amendement and helpynge of his reame in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and rulyd by xii of the grettest wysest lordes of the reame and wythout them Sholde no thynge be grauntyd ne done as before is sayd whiche couenauntes were malicyously put downe fro the kynge where many harmes shamys and repreues haue falle to the kyng hys reame and that is to vnderstonde for asmoche as Edwarde kynge of Englonde some tyme was ordeyned by assent in playne parlement for to be vnder warde gouernaunce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn for saluacyon of hys dody he was take out of the castell of Kenilworth there that he was in warde thrugh colour of quene Isabell of the Mortymer without consent of ony parlement they tooke ladde hym there that neuer after none of his kynred myght wyth hym speke ne see after tratorursly toke morored hym for whose deth arose a sklaudre thrugh all crystendom whan it was done And also the tresore ye syre Edwarde of

the quene Isabell the Mortymer after theyr retenwe after the kyngys retenewe soo that they had ordeyned amonge them an huge hoste And they counseylled the kynge so that vppon a nyght  they rode xxiii myles to Bedford there the erle of Lancastre was with his company and thought to haue hym dystroyed and that nyght she rode besyde the kynge her sone as a knyght for drede of dethe And it was done the

thrugh ony maner coniectynge For he was to coueytous hadde to moche his wyll and that was grete pyte How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to doo his homage vnto the kynge of Frau ce for the duchye

syr roger mortymer of wygmore that desyred and coueted to be at an hygh astate so that the kyng grauntyd hym to be callyd erle of Marche thorughe out all hys lordshyp And he became soo proude hauteyn yt he wolde lese forsake the name yt his elders had euer be fore for ye cause he let hym calle erle of marche And none of the comnyns of Englonde durste calle hym by other name for he was callyd so by ye kyngys crye that men shold calle hym erle of Marche And mortymer bare hym so hauteyn so proude that wonder it was for to wyte also dysguysed hym with wonder ryche clothes out of al manere of reason both of shapynge and of werynge wher of the Englysshmen had grete wonder how and in what manere he myght contryue or fynde suche manere pryde they s  yd amonge them comynly yt his pryde sholde not

wretchydnesse that he helde a rounde table in walys to all men that the der came and couterfeted the doynge and the manere of kyng Arthurs table but openly he fayled for the noble kynge Arthur was ye moost noble lord of renomme that was in all the worlde in hys tyme yet came neuer none suche after For all ye noble knyghtes i all cryste dom of dedys of armys assayed dwellyd wyth kynge Arthur helde

he was alyue in the castell of Corf wherof all the comyns of Englonde almoost were i sorowe and drede whether that it were soo or not For they wist not how traytoursly Mortymer had hym done murthred How Edmonde of wodstok that was erle of Kente the kynges brother Edwarde of Carnaryuan was heedyd at wynchestre ANd vppon a tyme it befell soo that syr Edmonde of wodstok erle of Kent spake vnto pope Iohan the xxii at Auinion sayde that almyghty god had ofte tymes done for Thomas loue of Lancastre many grete myracles to many men and wymmen yt were thrughe dyuers maladyes vndoone As vnto the worlde and thrughe his prayer they were broughte vnto there helthe and soo syr Edmonde prayed the pope hertely that he wolde graunt hym grace the forsayde Thomas myghte be traunslatyd But the pope sayde naye that he sholde not be traunslatyd vnto the tyme that he were better certyfyed of the clergye of Englond and seen by theyr obedyence what thynge god had done for the loue of saynt Thomas of Lacastre after the suggestio that the forsayd erle of Kent hadde vnto hym made And whan this Edmonde saw that he myght not spede of his purpos as touchynge the traunslacion He prayed hy of cousell as touchynge syr Edwarde of Carnariuan hys brother sayd that not longe agon he was kynge of Englonde what thynge myghte beste be done as touchynge his delyuerauce sythe yt a comune fame was thrugh Englonde yt he

saue his body in all manere that he myght And to brynge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym his copany a pena et culpa all that to his delyuerauce Tho toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of ye pope came ayen into Englode wha syr Edmonde was come some of ye frere prechers came sayd that syr Edwarde his brother yet was alyue in ye castell of Corf vnder ye kepynge of syr Thomas Gurnay tho sped hy

acquayntaunce of hym to knowe of his cousell And thus it befel that the forsayd Edmonde prayed specyally to tel hym pryuely of his lorde his brother syr Edward yf that he lyued or were deed yf he were alyue he prayed hym ones to haue a syght of hym And this syr Iohn Daueryl was a hygh herted ma ful of courage answerde shortly to syr Edmond sayd that syr Edwarde hys brother was in helth vnder hys

Mortymer that he sholde shewe hys body to noo ma of the world sauf only to the vpo lyf lyme disherytynge of his heyres for euer more But the fals traytour falsly lyed For he was not in his warde but was take thes and lad to the castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas of gurney by the comaudemente of Mortymer tyll he was dede as before is sayd But syr Edmonde of wodstok wyst no thynge that syr edwarde his brother was deed wherupon he toke a letter vnto kyng Edward his brother as to his worthy lorde receyued ye letter of hym and behyght hym ryght faythful to do his message without fayll And with that syr Edmonde toke leue of the forsayd Iohn and yede into his owne coutre lordshyp in kent that he had there Anone as this same Iohan wist that syr Edmonde was gone into Kent his owne lordshyp anone he went in all ye hast that he myght fro the Castell of Corf came vnto syr Roger Mortymer and toke hym the letter that syr Edmond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closyd and ensealed with his owne seale And whan syr Roger Mortymer had receyued the letter he vnclosed it and sawe that was conteyned therin began it to rede wherof the begynnynge was this Worshyppes and reuerence wyth

armour with tresour wythout nombre for to mayntene your quarell so ferforth that ye shall be kynge agayn as ye were before and that they haue sworne to me vpon a boke and aswell prelates as erles and barons Whan syr Roger Mortymer saw vnderstode the myght and the strenth of the letter anone his hert for wrathe began to boll and euyll herte bare to ward syr Edmode of wodstok that was erle of kent and wyth all the hast that he myght he wente vnto dame Isabell the quene that was ye was the kynges moder shewed her syr Edmonds letter his wyll and his purpose and how that he had coniected ordeyned to put downe kynge Edwarde of wyndsore her sone of his ryalte and of his kyngdome Nowe certes syr Roger sayd she hathe syr Edmonde done so now by my faders soule sayde she I wyll be therof auenged yf that god graunte me lyf and that in a shorte tyme And with that quene Isabell wente vnto kynge Edwarde her sone there he was att the parlemente at wynchestre to haue amende the wrongys and the trespasses that were done amonge the people of hys reame tho she toke and shewed hym the letter that syr Edmond of wodstok had made and ensealed with hys owne seale and badde hym vpon her blessynge that he sholde be auengyd vpon syr edmond as vpon his dedely enmye Tho was the quene sore wrothe to warde syr Edmonde erle of Kente And sessyd neuer to praye vntyll her sone tyll that he had sente in all the hast after hym And vpon that the kynge sent by hys letters after syr Edmoode of wodstok that he sholde come speke wyth hym att wynchestre all manere thinge left And whan syr edmond sawe that the kynge sente after hym wyth hys letters ensealed ye hastyd hym in alle yt he myghte tylle that he came to wynchestre But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was come to wynchestre tho anone she prayed and so faste wende vnto kynge edwarde her sone that the good erle was arested anone and ladde vnto the barre before Robert of Hamonde that was Coroner of the kynges housholde And he assocyed vnto hym syr Roger Mortymer And tho spake the for sayd Roger and sayde syr edmonde erle of Kent ye shall vndersto de that it is done vs to wyte and pryncypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge edwarde of englonde almyghty god hym saue and kepe that ye be his deedly enmye and a traytoure and also a comune enmye to the reame and that ye haue ben aboute many a day For to make pryue delyueraunce of syr edwarde somtyme kynge of englonde your broder the whiche somtyme was put downe of hys ryaltee by ye comyn assent of the lordes of englond in peasynge of our lorde the kynges estate and also of his reame Tho answerd the good man and sayd For soth syr vnderstonde well that I was neuer traytoure to my kynge ne to the reame that I doo me on god and on all the worlde therfore by my kynges leue I shalle it preue defende as a man ought for to do Tho sayde Mortymer syr Edmonde it is so ferfor the knowe that it may not be well gaynsayd and that in presence of all that here been it shalle be well prouyd Now had this fals mortymer the same letter that syr edmonde hadde take to Syr Iohan Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kynge edwarde hys brother that syr Edmonde wyst not of ne supposed no thynge that syr Iohn Daueryll had be so fals to delyuer his letter in suche wyse vnto Mortymer And thought no manere of thynge of that letter Thenne Mortymer sayd to syr edmonde and shewed a letter sealed axed hym yf that he knewe ye letter and ye seale This syr edmonde lokyd theron auysed hym longe tyme on the prynte of the seale for he myght not see the letter with in and wyst well that it was his seale thought that it had be somme letter that had bore no grete charge thought no thinge of that other letter And sayd openly in herynge of them all ye for soth thys is my seale and I wyll it not for sake Lo sayde the Mortymer syres ye here al what he hath sayd that he knowlegyth hym that this is his letter hys seale And now ye shall here what is conteyned therin thenne Mortymer openyd the letter that he had folde tofore togyder redde it openly worde by worde in herynge of theym all whan the letter was redde he sayd Loo syres ye haue herde alle ye herin is wryte and that he hath knowlegyth that this is his letter his seale he may not go therfro And thenne they cryed yaue dome that he sholde be hangyd drawen hys heed smyten of in a manere of a traytour he hys heyres dysheryted for euer more so he was ladde forth and put in to pryson and whan this was done the quene wist that he was dampned by way of lawe both of lyf and of lyme hys heyres dysheryted for euermore thrugh open knowlegynge in playncourt where them thought that it were good that the forsayd syr Edmond were hastyly slayne wythout wyttynge of the kyng or elles the kynge wolde lyghtly foryeue hym hys dethe thenne it shode torne theym so moche sorowe so as he was empechyd And anone the quene thrugh counseyll of the Mortymer and wyth out ony other counsell sent in hast to the Baylyfe of wynchestre that they sholde smyte of Syr Edmondes heed Erle of Kente wythout ony manere abydynge or respyte vpon payne of lyf and lymme And that he sholde haue none other execusyon By cause of caryenge not withstandynge the Iugement Tho toke the Baylyes syr edmonde out of pryson and ladde hym besyde the castell of wynchestre there they made a gonfermer smyte of hys heed for none other durste it doo and soo he deyed there alas the whyle That is to say the tenth daye of Octobre the thyrde yere of kynge Edwarde regne And whan the kyng wist therof he was wonder sory and lete entyere hym at the frere Mynors at wynchestre Of the deth of syr Roger Mortymer Erle of Marche ANd so it befell at that tyme that syr Roger Mortymer erle of ye Marche was so proude and so hauteyne that he helde no lorde of the reame his pere And tho became he so coueytous that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte that was kynge Edwards moder and beset hys peny worth with the offycers of the quenes house holde in the same manere that the kynges offycers dyde And so he made his takynge as touchynge of vytayle and also of caryages and all he dyde for bycause of expencys and to gadre tresoure And so he dyde without nombre in all that he myght Tho had he made hym wonder preuy wyth the quene Isabell And so moche lordshyppe and rete we had that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad wherfore the kyng and his counseylle to warde hym were agreued And ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym thoroughe pure reason and lawe for cause that kynge Edwarde that was ye kyges fader traytoursly thrugh hym was murdred in the castel of Corf as before is sayde more playnly in some parte of his boke of his deth And some that were of the kynges counseyll louyd Mortymer tolde hym in preuyte how that ye kynge

doubte in storyes how in what manere they were put a way dystroyed out of Brytayne Now it is to declare how the Pyctes were dystroyed sayled Girp ca vii Brytayn was somtyme occupyed with Saxons peas was made and stablysshed with the Pyctes thenne the Scottes that came with the Pyctes sawe that the Pyctes were nobler of dedes better me of armes though they were lasse in nombre than the scottes Thene the Scottes hauynge therof enuye torned to theyr naturall treason yt they haue oft vsed for in treason they passe other me and ben traytours as it were by kynde For they prayed all the Pyctes specyally the grete of them to a feest wayted her tyme whan the Pyctes were mery had well dronke they drew vp nayles that helde vp holowe beches vnder the pyctes the pyctes vnware sodaynly fyll in

Scotes whiche ben traytours all vnlyke to the pyctes toke prouffyte by that fals treason for they tooke alle that londe and holde it yet vnto thys tyme and it Scotlonde after hyr owne name In kynge Edgars tyme Kynadin Alpinus sone was duke and leder of the Scottes and warred in Pycte londe and destryyed the Pyctes He warred syx sythes in Saxon and tooke all the londe that is bytwene Twede and

couered mekely theyr faders membres whan he was slepynge And his sone Cham for his scornynge his vnreuerence he cursed  And here after saynt Austyn is made ye fyrst mencyon of bondage and of noblenes cotrary to it For Noe sayd that Cham sholde be seruaut in bondage to Sem and Iaphet for his  ureuerence Neuerthelesse ye shall not trowe that all that descended of Cham were vnnoble men of no power For they began fyrst to be myghty men of ye erth As it is open of Nemroth and the kynge of Chanaan Astorum Nor all of Sem Iaphet were vertuous noble myghty men whan almoost euerychone fell vnto ye

so they were disperpled through all the worlde Of ye malyce of this Nemroth bokes ben wryten full And after ye confusyon of ye language he went to ye londe of Perce and there he taught them to adoure the fyre as god He lefte his sone Belus in Babylon whiche succeded after hym And so his progenye obtayned that realme after many yeres In this tyme began many kyngdomes the moost of all those kyngdomes was the kyngdome of Scitaru But there were so many rude people in it yt the cite was no worshipped yet was it a myghty regyon of dystauce And about this tyme began ye kyngdome of Egypte the whiche was chauged many tymes with dyuers alteracyons also it is spoken of many tymes i scripture  Noblenes or gentylmen began about this sayd tyme And this noblenes or gentylmen was ordeyned for many causes  The fyrst cause was necessite for wha mankynde grewe sore men were prompte redy to do hurt domage to other it was very necessary to wtstande ye grete malyce of ye cursed and wycked people agaynst good ryghtwyse men Therof a man is called gentylman or a noble man as before other in vertues notable wherof saynt Ierom sayth I se nothynge els in noblenes or in gentylmen but yt they are bouden in a certayne necessite yt they shall not recede fro the vertue the gen tylnes of theyr noble aucetours  The seconde was ye dyuers worshyppyng of the people for no man worshypped tha but as his naturall reason gaue they knewe not veryly what they shold worship for they were so dull of wytte that they coude pondre no grete thynge but that was publysshed by the comyn people Wherfore it was expediet for theyr peace to be kepte that they sholde haue prynces of noble byrthe  The thyrde cause cedeth of some singuler strength Many tymes ye comynaltees were greued through ennemyes comynge vpon them than they sayd yt who someuer wolde defende them fro those perylles he sholde haue the right of noblenes for hym for his heyres for euermore And in this maner of wyse many are redde to be noble men  The fourth cause of noblenes was haboundauce of goodes Somtyme ye people were holden with grete penury of meet drynke than they toke them theyrs to some ryche man that through that couenaut they sholde tempre ye grete straytnes of theyr honger after that they sholde knowe hym as theyr lorde a noble man Also there be foude certayn noble men by the uysyon of god though they were but fewe of yt whiche som abode i vertue as Dauyd some fayled anone as Saul and Ieroboam And it is redde yt many were noble men by tyrany of yt whiche some were destroyed anone some abode in stablenes as

And aboute this tyme ydolatry began myghtely And yf ye re uolue loke ye hystoryes ye shall fynde that thre thynges princypally brought men to ydolatry that is to wyt  the affeccyon that they had to

wycked spirytes confermed the errour of the people myghtely In soo moche that who someuer wolde not conferme hym to theyr reason he sholde greuously suffre the payne of dethe Also there was added and
