stand in need of armes and valour to maintaine the strife the cursed serpent makes with adams seed but of this treasure knowledge both to feed their soules with food most pure celestiall and furnish with such weapons as they need i therefore her loues treasurer doe call for we in daily want stand of her treasure all by feigned treasure did the serpent traine our two first parents to their cursed sinne pretending they should goodly treasure gaine and knowledge both of good and euill win but good doth end where euill doth begin for drosse they doe exchange their purest gold the serpent bad without themselues within they find the euill as the serpent told but vp to heavn flies good which can no ill behold thus all our treasures lost we had before the knowledge of gods nature and his will and we become vnarmd rude naked poore of all things ignorant but doing ill now vs our enemies may easily kill we hauing lost our weapons and our treasure which wealth and weapons if regaine we will we

beautie show and richest treasures which in golden chest thou hidst from hell and malice of the beast knowledge containd in either testament wherein thy will and nature is exprest how we should liue and serpents sting preuent how conquer hell and serue thee with a true intent some knowledge call thhabit of demonstration some her to know by causes doe define some thvnderstandings sound determination wee her to heaunly doctrine here confine which in a threefold booke to man doth shine of creatures first and latter testament the booke of creatures shewes gods power diuine the law is much in types and shadowes spent whereof the gospel is the full accomplishment in booke of creatures all men may obserue gods wisdome goodnesse power and prouidence by which he made the world and doth preserue in truest motions its circumference sending from heavn raines sweetest influence filling our hearts with mirth and ioyfulnesse and giuing all things motion being sense this doth gods power and godhead plaine expresse but not his will which leads to endlesse happinesse yet by this booke are left without excuse idolaters who downe to stocks doe fall which their owne hands haue made for such abuse and leaue their maker blessed ouer all who as his power and goodnesse generall appeares most plainly in this worlds creation so doth his gracious bountie on them fall in sending food for daily sustentation and in their healths and liues continuall preseruation the next two bookes most plainly doe disclose gods will particular and generall particular to patriarchs prophets those that till christs time on god aright did call for this did not on all the nations fall gods will was then in iury onely knowne but now the gospel soundeth out to all the seed thereof in eury nations sowne which doth reueale hid mysteries before vnknowne the first gods power and prouidence doth shew the second types out our regeneration the third directly leadeth vs to know all that is needfull for our owne saluation evn from election to glorification this booke reueales all secret mysteries hidden in christ before the worlds foundation though worldlings this as folly doe despise yet this true knowledge onely happy makes and wise as some great princes might and maiestie is often to the meanest stranger knowne but his most secret counsell and decree to friends and counsellours is onely showne evn so the king of kings holds not vnknowne from heathens sight his maiestie and might but hath disclosed onely to his owne the secret of his counsells and delight whereby they may him worship please and serue aright this is the knowledge which i seeke to trace this onely doth true happinesse affoord whereof the onely cause is inward grace and vnderstanding gods most holy word the helpes which humane learning doe record law history arts physicke poetrie are but as seruants waiting on their lord and handmaids to their dame diuinitie all knowledge without this is foolish vanitie sweet grace which dost true knowledge of gods will to babes and sucklings oftentimes reueale when from great clerkes of wisdome and deepe skill thy pleasure is this treasure to conceale oh sacred breath which in our hearts doth steale like sweetest zephyrus most pleasing wind whence no man knowes yet doth it surely seale that certaine knowledge which i seeke to find knowledge of god and christ the sauiour of mankind all graces that doe serue loues royall queene from heauenly knowledge haue their maintenance and alwayes in her company are seene none without knowledge may neere loue aduance with her are diligence and temperance true faith so neere her euer doth attend you would her take for knowledge at a glance though often faith doth so her selfe transcend that shee beyond the reach of knowledge doth ascend not faith alone but workes accompany true knowledge who in words doth make profession he knowes god but in workes doth him deny is evn a lyar by his owne confession how many from this rule doe make digression that would in knowledge be accounted high but giue themselues to pride lust and oppression enuy dissembling schisme idolatry alas true knowledge neuer kept such company some onely seeke to know that they may know and this is foolish curiositie and some of learning make a goodly show and this is base and idle vanitie some knowledge seeke for their vtilitie or their preferment which is filthy gaine some to teach other which is charitie some by this knowledge seeke heavn to attaine to know and walke not right is damnable and vaine i liken this true knowledge to the flower or blossome springing from the root of grace that doth most gloriously adorne loues bower and fills with pleasant odours all the place which blossome beautifull in little space it selfe into most goodly fruits doth spend faith mercy peace each good and perfect grace which fruit so farre the flower doth transcend god men and angels tast it and the same commend as blossomes doe not from root liuely spring that after blowing haue a fruitlesse fall so knowledge that in workes is vanishing had neuer any root from grace at all but is like to good seed thats said to fall from sowers hand downe by the highway side whose rooting being shallow loose and small could not the suns hot scorching heat abide but in the blade with some small light affliction dide some liken heaunly knowledge to the sunne then which in this world nothing more to sight obiected is but we by sinne become like him borne blind depriud of naturall light till some power supernaturall enlight and though more plaine in this world nothings showne than gods eternall godhead goodnesse might yet vntill grace enlighten tis vnknowne no cause hereof in god but in our selues is knowne knowledge is like the talents which the lord when he went forth did to his seruants lend the first who his one talent vp did hoard like him that for his knowledge doth contend but therewith not himselfe nor others mend hee that with talents two gaind other twaine is he that doth his time and labour spend to saue himselfe and those with him remaine but he that gaind the fiue seeks all mens soules to gaine i knowledge to the virgins lamps compare which foolish maids had common with the wise oile workes of pietie and mercy are which foolish virgins idlely doe misprise but when one loe the bridegrome comes out cryes the foolish virgins lamps are spent and done wherefore they must to merits merchandize and borrow when they of their owne haue none the churches treasury will furnish evry one like widowes oile that doth encrease by spending like flames that lightning others gaine more light like vsurers coine that doth augment by lending like ioy that most encreaseth by delight like manna that the angels food is hight whereof each gathers what may him suffice except such as in fleshpots more delight like springs which more you draw the faster rise like tutors who by teaching schollers grow more wise no simile can her so well expresse as infinite and boundlesse treasury or sea of waters which become no lesse though fountaines all with streames it doth supply how infinite is this grand mystery to lay of nothing this huge worlds foundation one god three persons in the trinitie oh depth of knowledge gods owne incarnation obedience passion resurrection exaltation oh i am drownd here elephants may swim my lambelike muse in shallow fords must wade and seeke for knowledge to desist from sinne and make faith mercy pietie my trade by faith i know christs merits mine are made the rest arefruits of my sanctification abundant knowledge doth with sorrow lade to know and doe gods willis delectation and onely by christs merits bringeth to saluation this is the knowledge which our sauiour meant when as he it eternall life did call to know god and the christ which he had sent this is the knowledge so much sought of all before and since the law and euer shall though till christs time it was so shadowed as couerd it in types and signes seemd small but since times fulnesse is accomplished behold they all in christ are easie to be read by this did abel offer of his sheepe the fat and god accepted his oblation by this so well gods law did henoch keepe hee him exalted from earths habitation for this did abram ieaue both house and nation assured that from out his loines should spring that knowledge which to know was his saluation herein did dauid though he were a king take more delight than crowne or any worldly thing see next his royall sonne king salomon then whom arise a wiser neuer shall who knew plants natures eun from lebanon her caedars tall to hysope by the wall who as in wealth in knowledge passed all yet after hee had traced uanitie and found how sonnes of men thereby did fall him to this knowledge did againe apply and swanlike sang christs churches epithalamy wake i or sleepe or am i in a trance or doe another salomon behold a dauid who doth far and wide aduance his gracious scepter but no bounds can hold his knowledge secret things for to vnfold law history arts and philosophy all noble sciences that can be told yet seemes to loue alone diuinitie which truely can direct in peace to liue and die who as hee is the learnedest of kings so tis his ioy and glory for to be the king of learned men which in all things makes god to prosper him as all may see this makes him raise to place of high degree men of great knowledge well to rule the land and put downe ignorance and subtiltie which highest in their owne conceits doe stand long sway thou brittons scepter with thy sacred hand and when thy cloake eliaslike must fall vpon elisha thine vndoubted heire inherite hee thy peace and knowledge all and in thy spirit rule as in thy chaire but i must leaue this field so ample faire teach mee o lord to know and doe thy will and let thy grace againe in me repaire thine image lost and all corruptions kill thus we thy will on earth as they in heavn fulfill this knowledge must stand by vs at our last when as wee ready are our soules to tender to him that for false knowledge curious tast though guiltlesse did his life to iustice render for this the holy ghost doth more commend her that bare her sauiours knowledge in her brest than that shee bare him in her wombe yet tender for one all generations call her blest by thother one of his true members shee doth rest but though this onely necessary is and first for our saluation to be sought wee onely at our last of it haue misse as too meane subiect for ambitious thought thus the vnlearned rise and heavn haue cought when greatest clerks with sciences profound heartlesse and comfortlesse to hell are brought for god doth their great wisedome oft confound because their inward parts are not sincere and sound alas of knowledge here we haue no care but all our youth in follies idely spend our strength in lusts and strifes away we weare in age we worldly profit all intend alas what gaine we by this at our end when our fraile body doth returne to dust our soule to him that gaue it must ascend whereof least iot of time account they must which hath been spent in discord profit folly lust oh knew we but the vertue of this treasure like to the merchant wise we would sell all to buy it where we should find profit pleasure such ioy as neuer on our hearts did fall oh heavnly comfort ioy spirituall delight vnspeakeable in hearts that grow of those that shee is conuersant withall what ioy can there be greater than to know gods endlesse loue in christ which shee to vs doth show sure i could wish my whole life here to spend in this diuine most holy contemplation whereof i know not how to make an end shee yeelds such plentie of sweet meditation most heavnly mysteries of our creation wherein appeare gods might and maiestie but aboue all his loue in mans saluation this is that wondrous hidden mystery into the which eun angels did desire to pry but we confesse though thou dost here reueale abundant knowledge yet we little know wherefore gainst vs the heathen may appeale who though thou didst to them but glimpses show of truth and iustice did more righteous grow than wee that doe thy sacred truth confesse and make of puritie a glorious show but to adorne the gospel we professe with workes of charitie ah wee doe nothing lesse  page duplicate  page duplicate oh

clouenfiery tongues forth sound the knowledge of thy truth to evry nation canst make this knowledge in mine heart abound by one sparke of diuine illumination and rauish my weake soule with heavnly admiration and though imperfect here our knowledge be by reason of our humane imperfection and for by faith alone we things doe see and nothing know indeed in true perfection yet when thy spirit cleares our minds infection wee shall then know evn as we now are knowne and things now seene by mirrourlike inspection to vs shall be most euidently showne in knowledge we shall reape what we in

disposition by rules of art i formerly define but zeale so feruent is no definition can her containe or bound in any line onely shee is by nature pure diuine beloued daughter to the queene of loue whose mothers graces so in her doe shine shee well the primate of her court may proue and ranked be for place all other peares aboue i here omit that zeale which without hate of others doth to vertuous deeds contend and vs enflames that good to emulate which we to be in others apprehend i here that holy iealousie commend which onely doth from loue diuine proceed when not for our but gods cause we intend to loue both him and his in word and deed for this is that right zeale which of true loue doth breed truth comes by knowledge and from zeale deuotions when therefore zeale doth with true knowledge meete shee doth inlarge our hearts with heavnly notions sublime transcendant admirable sweet but where this knowledge wants shees vndiscreet rash violent seditious rude and blind faults for so faire a lady farre vnmeet you see two zeales here of a differing kind i leaue the worst and seeke the fairest out to find sweet lady daughter to the queene of loue which is the cause of zeale

such ancestry goodnesse and loue which therefore wee require to true effects of loue and goodnesse to aspire sweet zeale how fairely dost thou beautifie thaffection where thou makst thy habitation like temple which thy lord did purifie when as his soule with zeale and indignation was moud to see gods temples prophanation not suffering thy house of endlesse rest to be abusd by pride or lustfull passion thaffection which doth lodge within my brest the temple where christ and the holy ghost should rest companions of zeale are pietie faith knowledge patience fortitude and right in workes of mercy peace and charitie and sweet humilitie is her delight with all her power shee is opposite against all that gods glory may oppose shee spends in feruent prayers day and night and those by

most violently no streames or flouds can quench her sacred ire should we sell all we haue we could not buy her the daughter zeale is like the mother free them both from heaun th almightie doth inspire and therefore neither will affronted bee with riualls heathen gods most base idolatree fond zeale thats fitly called which doth want faith knowledge loue diuine and graces all it still doth most vaine superstitions haunt and to most base idolatry doth fall vnhumane fury madnesse tragicall of men whom thus blind zeale and strange desire transports beyond rage diabolicall to offer vp their children in the fire of some offended deuill to appease the ire strange is this zealous fury of the rude when ignorance doth guide their blind deuotion the gathering of the froward multitude when they be stirred with some feruent motion all following some brainesicke idle notion with discontent against authoritie raise schismes in church in commonwealth commotion pretending all their conscienceliberty alas these be no fruits of holy iealousie god often by an anthropopathy by which his nature best wee vnderstand ascribes vnto himselfe this iealousie as being linkd in hymens holy band vnto his church his vndefiled and his church againe to shew her feruent loue and ioy shee takes in her new ioyned hand like louesicke bride the bridegroome oft doth proue and him with zeale inuites her to imbrace and

to fountaines moue of teares to heare the churches piteous mone when shee doth misse him whom her soule doth loue wheres my beloud ah whither is shee gone and left his saddest deare to sigh and sit alone and therefore as a signet on his heart and as the seale that is on his right hand shee would be ioynd that shee might neuer part but alwayes in his grace and presence stand no keeper in christs vineyard must command hee will his vineyard prune and dresse alone whereby his iealousie wee vnderstand his vine the bridegroome will haue drest of none the bride out of his presence neuer will be gone doth mine inuention faile that wont to flow in similes that make hard things seeme plaine or doth the whole creation here below nothing affoord zeales nature to explaine alas all earthly similes are vaine texpresse the nature of this heaunly fire which in the glorious angells doth remaine and in the spirits of that blessed quire which here with hymnes and praises doe gods loue admire shall dust and ashes dare yet be so bold her to the holy fire to compare which in the bush thy seruant did behold flaming but did the bush not singe or seare such flames of zeale oft in our hearts there are which doe enlighten them but not consume these flames our prayers to iehoua beare by these our praises spiritually vp fume and in gods nostrils are like incense and perfume or shall i like her to some lionesse robd of her whelps by some aduenturous hand who in her wondrous woe and furiousnesse deuours and slayes all in her way that stand who can the force of iealousie withstand being of so great strength and wondrous might god grant our zeale the truth may vnderstand and that true knowledge may your minds inlight to make vs zealous for gods glory and the right may i not like her to strong churlish wine which doth confound the braine inflame the blood but coold with water pure and sugar fine for both of them is soueraigne and good eun so doth iealousies most feruent mood allaid with sugar of sweet charitie and coold with sweetest christalline pure floud the silent streames of soft humilitie transcend in all good workes of loue and pietic this is the zeale and sacred emulation which the originall doth signifie which hath with loue in heaun her habitation and all our actions here doth sanctifie and when our maker vs shall glorifie behold our zeale shall in perfection shine begun on earth in true sinceritie and as our fleshly courage doth decline our zeale will grow more hot and neerest to diuine zeale made old abram hagars sonne reiect for scoffing at his holy promisd seed and moses pharaohs court and grace neglect when hee th egyptians destiny did reed that smote a brother of the holy breed this zeale made noble phineas with his speare slay zimry and cosbi in their damned deed though saul the fat of amalec would spare yet samuels zeale doth agags flesh in pieces teare oh had his master elis burnt so hot against his sonnes when they by violence the fattest of gods offrings from him got and with foule lust defild the sacred tents had he like phineas punisht this offence our eares then should not haue so tingeled to heare of gods great wrath and sore offence he and his sonnes in one day slaughtered and all his race from th arke for euer banished zeale made the warlike dauid to aspire to build an house for gods owne habitation and though warres crost his zeale and good desire yet made he for it royall preparation ands sonne it finisht on his laid foundation who gold and siluer vessels in did bring it making iudahs ioy the admiration of all the world the seat of the great king whither the tribes goe vp for his true worshipping i may with this example dignifie the noble zeale of our late famous queene who much desired to reedifie paules temples ruines which so fearefull seeme and make her faire as euer shee was seene but warres abroad and broiles within her land most fatall to this pious worke haue beene so as it still most ruinous

loathing the worlds vaine wanton wicked dallyings this cupid be thy soules and hearts delight whose bow and golden shafts of zeale and loue doe conquer furys fates and worlds despight and stay the thunderbolts of angry ioue oh see the force of loue and zeale doth moue all powers that in heaun earth hell transcend grant thee alone i zealously may loue and let thy iealousie me safe defend that neuer to strange gods i my affection bend let vs learne zeale of him that in the days ofs slesh did offer prayers supplication with strongest crys and teares to god alwayes that able was to saue him from his passion and learne of him true holy indignation to be evn eaten vp with feruent zeale to see theeues den in gods owne habitation but first let knowledge our commission seale that where this feruour wounds our charitie may heale but ah our zeale of prayer now growes cold zeale of gods glory like our charitie and as the world declines now waxing old evn so doth all our zeale and pietie we raise our houses evn to dare the skie but raze gods temples equall with the ground our fathers built them for posteritie and left with ornaments adorned round but we them with their ornaments seeke to confound as for the temples of the holy ghost i meane our hearts the bridegroomes habitation we will bestow on them no spirituall cost but leaue them foild with vilest prophanation pride lust vaineglory all abomination tis time to wish this holy bishops zeale would make of them to god new consecration and that the holy ghost their doores would seale against all spirituall theeues that holy goods would steale oh that some holy fit of heaunly fire raising my muse to zealous contemplation would in mine heart that feruent flame inspire and zealous loue saint paul bare to his nation when as hee could haue wisht eun reprobation for their sakes from whose flesh christ did descend or of the prophet by predestination most sure his name in booke of life was pend yet wisht it wiped out gods glory to defend but i confesse we rather doe enuy gods gifts and graces in our bretheren and iosuahlike forbid them prophesie shewing more zeale to honour greatnesse then to glorifie the king of heaun yea when we in our hearts find any emulation tis for vaineglory and the praise of men to build our houses not gods habitation and leaue faire large possessions to our generation let vs with dauid make a sacred vow and to thalmightie god of iacob sweare neuer to come within our house nor bow our limbs vpon our beds till we prepare a place gods spirituall temple vp to reare nor euer suffer sleepe

of danger past that tost his vessell oft vp to the skies now sailing in the calme with temperate blast goes gently on lest too much dangerous hast his ship vnwares on hidden rocke impight and him and all his hopes away should cast for thus it oft befalls some carelesse wight to wreck in fairest calme when they the storme haue quight i late was tost in rough and boisterous sea of zeale and iealousie which hauing past i am to saile in calme and fairest lea of temperance most abstinent and chast therefore my muse goes on with sober hast knowing against her many dangers lie which by the touch tongue smell eye eare or taste would her entrap and bring in ieopardy which poets by the syrts and syrens doe imply and therefore did the famous blind bards quill preferre vlysses in his court of fame who of this temperance had got the skill fore aiax hector or achilles name his odysses may testifie the same which were composd his temperance to commend by which he men and monsters ouercame and did life honour chastitie defend gainst syrens and enchantments to his latest end and sure the heathen to all christians shame seemd wondrously vs herein to transcend but that they wanted that most holy flame of zeale which i so lately did commend and knowledge which should guide them to their end all that they had by natures light was showne but god his holy word to vs doth send whereby his will and counsell is made knowne what fruit then ought we beare where so good seed is sowne eue was the first author of intemperance led by her eye nice tast and fond desire of knowledge with proud wicked ignorance and changd gods loue to euerlasting ire the garden loosing for eternall fire but what shee lost his temperance doth gaine whose aid now in mine entrance i desire who from all food did fortie dayes abstaine and alls life from intemperate thought word deed refraine this vertue some doe make so cardinall that all the rest in her they would imply as loue peace concord pudour virginall gentlenesse meekenesse liberalitie thrift silence friendship goodnesse grauitie honesty purenesse all true moderation which doth withhold from sin and vanitie and bringeth vnto true humiliation most happy mother of so faire a generation but in some limits that i may her bound i her define to be a moderation of such desires as are within vs found in diet actions words and affectation for with these fowr i bound my meditation in diet shee requires sobrietie in actions true vnfaind humiliation her words she graceth aye with modesty and her affections charmes with meeknesse chastity see in her diet first sobrietie in words and actions true humiliation accompanyd with precious modesty last continence from lust and angry passion the cause of all is prudent moderation the aged palmer spencer guyons trustie guide that stands against all stubborne perturbation by whose sage helpe secure and safe we slide by whirlepooles and deepe gulfes which gape for vs so wide for all through this worlds boistrous sea must passe before we at our quiet havn arriue the boate our body is as brittle glasse our steeresman temperance it right doth driue besides the rocks that threat this boat to riue are many gulphes and whirlepooles of decay which wait th affections and the senses fiue by force and sweet allurements to assay some fall by rage and diet some by lustfull play but in that body where doth reason sway and sense and passion be obedient there the affections all behold you may in happy peace and goodly gouernment there temperance adornes her glorious tent with vertues all to make it shine most bright the mirrour of gods workes most excellent and to them all such bounteous banquets dight as may be best for health praise profit and delight most glorious frame of nature which shee built the whole world in one point tepitomize iust pure and perfect till intemprate guilt her makers hests by pride did foule misprise since that shee learned to belowly wise and not obey intemperate desire thus shee her glorious house reedifies and most of all doth lowly cells admire the loftiest is no place for temperate retire shee therefore neuer comes in company of such as swim in pride and bathe in blisse wasting their dayes in ease and luxury for in such ease men easily doe amisse but hee whose mind in studie watchfull is whose limbs are toyld

fame some call her alma some her bounty name the trusty almner of loues royall court who beares the bag to giue to blind and lame and suitors all that thither doe resort rewards most bounteously and feeds in seemely sort for on this heaunly dame the eyes of all looke vp that of her liberalitie they may receiue and shee againe lets fall vpon them needfull things most plenteously her bounteous hand shee opens willingly with blessings eury creature full to fill to those that knowledge seeke abundantly shee giueth wisdome vnderstanding skill to know their makers bountie maiestie and will most glorious alma when as temperance controlls the noble plentie of her hall and with her staffe keepes out intemperance which doth abuse her grace and bountie all for where most plentie is there most doe fall by want of temperance to lust and sin till they be brought low as the prodigall for he that will true praise by bountie win must first of all at home with temperance begin for temperance with watchfull diligence are like two springs which waters doe supply to open handed free beneficence and her discernes from prodigalitie by diligence we get sufficiencie by temperance what we haue gotten spare to minister to liberalitie for these two ladybountys handmaids are and for her iust and truly store of wealth prepare but they that liue in sloth and foule excesse though they may seeme to be most liberall oppression and extortion mercilesse are lakes from whence their bountys streamed doe fall and thus they rob the poore that therewithall they may themselues rich friends and children feast blaspheming their great maker lord of all and imitating basest sauage beast which fawnes vpon the great but doth deuoure the least god of all bountie king most liberall who to thy vassall man at his creation didst subiect make fish fowle beasts creatures all and of thine handy works gaust domination who by thy prouidence and ordination him needfull things not onely dost prouide but for his health delight and contentation that he may plentie to the poore diuide my muse to sing heart hands to practise bountie guide bountie beneficence benignitie in name though diuers one in substance be beneuolence and liberalitie make actions and affections agree if as they are in god you wish to see they like his goodnesse are vnlimitted and as his mercy loue and grace are free which on his creatures are abundant shed but by my shallow muse their depth cannot be read they are too high to reach too deepe to sound for all the earth is filled therewithall in heaun aboue gods goodnesse doth abound the bountie of his grace is ouer all of all the meditations which call my mind to holy ioy and admiration none lets more comfort than gods bountie fall both for my being and my preseruation but most in that he shed his bloud for my saluation here could i wish my muse might euer dwell in viewing gods great goodnesse bountie loue which three to thholy trinitie i well may here ascribe for goodnesse first doth moue the father to beget eternall loue from loue and goodnesse bountie doth proceed yet all these three as one in god doe proue in substance one although distinguished in working but this height my reach doth far exceed and therefore rauisht now with contemplation beyond the compasse of my feeble eye my soule amazd falls downe to adoration of this misterious holy trinitie and from diuine come to benignitie and bountie which should be in men below a habit wee of liberalitie her call and good affection we should show in thought heart word and deed to eury one we know and must from goodnesse and true loue proceed the onely cause of true benignitie wherefore except these be in vs indeed our bounty is but prodigalitie or some like froth of superfluitie the crums and leauings of intemperance which oft are dealt out with an euill eye more for vaine credit or base circumstance then for goodwill or care gods glory to aduance for eury act hath then her true effect which from true ground right aymeth at her end as when both loue and goodnesse doth direct what bounty truly gets aright to spend loe thus doth heaunly grace and bounty send her blessings temporall alike to all but doth for greater benefits intend to those that on gods name aright doe call and in this heaunly sort ought we be liberall oh then th effects of bounty glorious are when prouidence with true frugality doe seeke by iustice to prouide and spare fit sustenance for liberality behold that heaunly bounteous maiesty sends raine and fruitfull seasons whereby store of blessings thearth may to his hand supply and many hidden treasures vp doth store for to exalt the rich and to refresh the pore then humane bounty like her makers is when as shee labours to doe good to all but most of all to bring poore soules to blisse and fill their hearts with food spirituall oh grace diuine bounty angelicall with spirituall loaues in wildernesse to feed gods saints when spirituall hunger them doth gal the ignorant which pine with inward need diuine sweet comforts to their fainting soules to reade true bountys knowne best by her company for shee in truth and mercy takes delight faith iustice temperance humility and is withall loues graces richly dight herein appeares her glorious heaunly sprite shewing that shee of seed diuine is borne of loue and goodnesse not of vaine delight or fame and praise of men when shee doth scorne to seeke feignd bounteous shewes her goodnes to adorn for thus th ambitious man is bountifull thus bellygods in plentie take delight deceit with gifts his neighbour seekes to gull the couetous bribe large to conquer right from such false bounty truth is banisht quite humility faith knowledge temperance nor any of loues graces in her sight may suffered be their ensignes to aduance there dwells contention pride oppression ignorance as daughters of the horseleech still doe cry giue giue as graue and hell be neuer full so nought the couetous eye can satisfie but he thats liberall and bountifull is like full clouds which doe most plentifull water the earth and poure downe store of raine yet are not emptie for the mercifull and liberall shall greater plentie gaine and he that scattereth shall find increase againe that hand is neuer emptie of reward where as goodwill the hearts chest filleth full and bountie neuer is so much afeard causlesse to giue as not be bountifull where need requires his face is beautifull where sweet goodwill both heart and lookes haue ioynd but thenuious and malitious doe pull on wrinkles and a man shall euer find the beautie of the face to alter with the mind bountie is like vnto the glorious sun which as a bridegroome doth from chamber glide and as a gyant ioys his course to run from east to west most swiftly he doth ride nothing froms fertile heat it selfe can hide he doth not looke that one him vp should call so bountie deales her graces far and wide and blessings without asking sends to all expecting not vaine praise where shee lets graces fall as some faire glorious garment which we weare vpon our shoulders reaching to the ground couers all spots and naeues that on vs are so where this noble bounty doth abound it couereth all faults that can be found for as loue couers so doth bounty hide a multitude of sins and doth confound by her bright beames detraction enuy pride alas these are to weake where bountys on our side shees like vnto the lamp of glorious day which doth diuide the darknesse from the light for whereas bountie doth her beames display behold bright day without them there is night the king that by his bountie doth inuite his subiects hearts to loue and honour due sleepes more secure than he that doth by might and feare strong forts and walled townes subdue and for his guards encompassed with armed crue bountie and benefits are eun the bands of concord and as fire doth quickly dye that is not fostered with coles or brands so dies true loue with men except supply be made by gifts and liberalitie who doth the wandring soule direct aright though with him he doth deale most bounteously yet doth he but his fellowes candle light and to another giues yet loseth selfe no light true bounty seekes high god to imitate who to the most vnthankfull is most free sol doth his light to theeues participate and without tempests pirates saile on sea the heauns of all good things the authors bee faire fortunes to vngratefull fooles doe send as onely seeking to doe good so we though oft in vaine our bountie we doe spend to the vnthankfull must as to the thankfull lend gods bountys like to incense and perfume cast on an heart inflamd with holy zeale which praises vp like cloudes of smoake doth sume and sweetest odours round about doth deale mans bounty is like widowes cruse or meale which spent vpon the prophet growes to more like surgeons skill which as he more doth heale doth grow more cunning than he was before the diligent and bounteous hand want neuer store as many fruits doe faire encrease and grow not so much by the nature of the ground as by the bounty which from heaun doth flow and temperate aire that is about them found so all good arts in noblest wits abound more by some princes liberalitie and high regard they haue of muses sound than their owne nature strength and industry best friends to arts are bounty and humanity should i but here recount the names of all whom bountifull in holy writ i find i of your patience should be prodigall and my short time for this discourse assignd let me their names vp in a bundle bind which if you please to ope as sweetly smell as camphires bush my muse is now inclind of some prophane examples here to tell which seeme in noble bounty others to excell than treasure cyrus more his friends esteemd whereof he multitudes by bounty won and alexander greatest glory deemd by bounty neuer to be ouercome a king of egypt thought it better done his subiects coffers than his owne to fill when as alphonsus heard titus vespasians sonne accounted that day lost when for goodwill he had giun nought said i nere spent a day so ill behold these fiue examples liue in one the bounteous monarch that our scepter sways esteemes his friends boue gold or precious stone and ouercomes eun all that him obays by soueraigne bounty tos immortall praise no king so fills his subiects chests with gold his bounteous deeds in number passe his days ah how then dare my niggard rimes be bold the sacred bounty of my soueraigne to vnfold who hoards not vp his wealth in caue or tower nor into prisons darke condemnes his gold but as on him from heaun all blessings shower so are his to vs subiects manifold as from thicke clouds we numberlesse behold large streames of fruitfull raine on earth to fall so is his largesse to his seruants told who entring poore returne rich from his hall like tagus golden sands his hands are liberall vouchsafe oh bounteous soueraigne heare thy thrall after thy cloud a subiects dropd to sing whom thou didst to deserued honour call and was in name and bountie as a king who in thy bounteous steps thee following did from obscurity my fortunes raise without desert or my least offering he now in heaun his bounteous king doth praise as he with bounty honourd him here all his days and let vs all his bounteous praises sing whose bounty vs from hell and death doth raise our blessed sauiour prophet priest and king who here in bounteous deeds spent all his days casting out deuills sauing soules always healing the sicke giuing the blind their sight mournes for our sins for enemies he prays comforts the rich and feeds the hungry wight and still in doing good doth set his whole delight how could malicious heart of enuious man consent to murther such a bounteous king scourge scorne deride despight him what they can still in his bounteous deeds perseuering yea when vnto the crosse they him doe bring father they know not what they doe he crys and when his body hangs their torturing he to the thiefe not paradise denyes thus doing good he liues thus doing good he dyes what doth the lord of life eternall dye which vnto vs eternall life doth giue see his large bounty and benignity hee gaue his life for vs that we might liue what heart of stone doth not here melt or riue but with his life his bounty doth not end he by his will and testament doth giue vs heaun yea more the comforter doth send with millions of angells on vs to attend who can of this his sauiours bountie tast and to his members not be bountifull if thou want wealth and coine giue what thou hast and let our hearts be alwaies mercifull and like the fertile ground yeeld plentifull encrease of all the seeds which thereon grow tis bountie that doth fill our garners full he sparing reapes that sparingly doth sowe true bountys noble hand no want did euer know but ah too many couetous of praise and glory doe by fraud and rapine spoile others that they thereby there names may raise and some goods gotten by much care and toile spend on their pleasures and thereby beguile their poore and needy neighbour of his right drinking and surfetting in ease the while and spending frankly on some base delight like brutes are bountifull to their owne appetite some onely by their bountie seeke for fame and these are onely to ambition free some patrons now adays such shepheards name to feed the flocke as loose and idle bee wealth vnto wealth to adde they all agree mo man respects the needy and the poore the emptie vessels emptie still we see they that are full to them is added more dry hills want water when the valleys swim with store as knights which of the noble order are of garter that they better may be knowne a golden george about their necke they weare nor doe the same at any time lay downe whereby their noblenesse should be vnknowne so nobles alwaies weare benignitie whereby whose sonnes you are yee may be showne for nothing proues you sonnes of the most high more than your bountie and true liberalitie but of salse bountie you doe vainely boast delighting in vaine pastime oyle and wine and gluttons feed for glory to your cost whilst at your doores the poore may sterue and pine you welcome such as you inuite to dine but scarce afford the poore scraps at your gate which shew that all your bountie is to ioyne credit and glory to your great estate and but for crowes and kites or daws do lay a baite you for a million at a cast will play and hazard all your fortunes at a game and grudge not for one daintie bit to pay a thousand and then glory in the same with gold you tricke and trim vp some loose dame the sinke that sucks vp all your liberalitie thus lauish you to your eternall shame all that your fathers got by their frugalitie and left to you to spend in bounteous hospitalitie braue alexanders deeds for ay commends his wondrous confidence and bountie rare who dealing out amongst his faithfull friends lands houses townes he gold and all did share when one besought him wisely to forbeare for what said he alas is left the king new hopes of gaming more said he there are thus on his fate and fortunes venturing the heauns propitious seemd to him in eury thing but ah poore prince thy hopes are all but vaine as were the benefits thou didst expose but we are certaine of eternall gaine if bounteously gods blessings we dispose ah what is it if worldly things we loose and thereby gaine vs an eternall crowne which heaunly bountie layeth vp for those that their owne glory willingly lay downe and what they reape by bountie bounteously haue sowne such all within most gloriously shall shine their vestiments shall be of twined gold they shall of hony tast and spiced wine and all the bridegroomes fruits both new and old he gently will such in his armes infold and satisfie their sense with pleasing smell no eare hath heard no tongue hath euer told the ioy and bounty that with him doe dwell but more of these where next of heaunly ioy i tell meditat v of spirituall and heaunly ioy how should a heart opprest with worldly cares of spirituall inward ioy now rightly sing since none her knowes but who her image beares and feeles the spirits inward witnessing all sacred stuffe i to this building bring no helpe but he that abba father crys can teach my muse to touch this golden string i therefore here forbeare prophane supplys my spirit wholly on the holy spirit relys well said the king all worldly things are vaine and trauell which beneath the sun he found compared to left drop or minutes gaine which spirituall ioy did to his heart propound no reach of wisards skill no wit profound is able this true ioy to comprehend this musicke wholly to the saints doth sound the inward man can onely apprehend sweet liuely spirituall ioy which neuer shall haue end no muses darling euer yet did dreame of this sweet wind which where it lists doth blow this onely is sweet israels singers theame which he by heaunly influence did show and then most when the outward man brought low by paine of body or by griefe of mind did from his pen diuinest comforts flow most heaunly ioys which he was wont to find to grow more strong within as he without declind oh ioy of ioys vnspeakeable delight eun when our soules the powers of hell doe shake and vs with iustice and due vengeance fright when as our guilty conscience is awake that all with terrour tremble horrour quake that then our gentle beame of heaunly grace not onely shall from vs this horrour take but in loues armes vs in an instant place they onely know this ioy that haue beene in this case if euer i receiued strength and skill from heaun to scale the hill of contemplation i now doe hope gods gracious spirit will me fill with ioy for his sweet meditation oh blessed spirit who by sweet inspiration directest eury holy prophets quill enlighten mine by heauns illumination that most diuine sweet ioys it may distill into the readers heart and mine with comfort fill no tongue could euer tell no heart conceiue therefore no art is able to define what is the inward ioy which we receiue by peace of conscience and grace diuine but sure it is that speciall marke or signe which on our soules the holy spirit of grace most gently doth imprint and liuely line whereby we doe behold gods cheerefull face and spiritually feele our bridegroomes sweet embrace there is a naturall and carnall ioy besides this inward ioy spirituall by one we common blessings here enioy by thother we in sin and errour fall those be partakers of ioy naturall that health of body haue and worldly store the carnall ioy we sinfull pleasures call excesse of meate and wine lips of a whore and all mans vaine delights gainst rule of heaun lore these ioys which with false pleasures vs deceiue are not of kin to ioy spirituall for that they always doe our hearts bereaue of inward ioyes pure food angelicall gods goodnesse is thefficient cause of all and though each person in the trinitie may seeme to haue a working seuerall yet all in one and one in all agree with ioy here to begin mans true felicitee there many causes are materiall why we this inward ioy in vs should haue gods freest grace which doth most surely call all those that he elected hath to saue the peace of conscience which ioy vs gaue and eke the ioy of our sanctification whereby eun heauens inheritance we craue and certainly expect glorification and are inuited guests to heauns participation as are gods gifts and graces infinite so causes are of ioy spirituall it fills my soule with infinite delight when all his benefits to mind i call but none like this thats sonne should saue vs all by that great secret of his incarnation which made the babe into ioys passion fall at blessed mothers heaunly salutation and made blind simeons soule reioyce in his saluation this made the mother of the babe to sing and her sweet little lord to magnifie her sauiour which shee in her armes did bring this made in heaunly host such melody when newes was brought of his natiuity oh ioy of ioys to you is borne this day a sauiour god from all eternitie this made the wisemen from the east to stray and offer to him gifts that in a cradle lay this made the holy king propheticall though many pleasant lays to harpe hee sing straine none so high and so patheticall as those of his sonne sauiour lord and king oh then each stroake hee strikes to heaun doth ring his heart reioyceth and his tongue is glad such ioy doth hope of resurrection bring that though his flesh be with corruption clad his heart shall neuer faint nor soule be euer sad we for this hope it count exceeding ioy when we doe fall on many sore temptations and when afflictions most abound we ioy in trialls sufferings and tribulations the angells in their holy habitations at our conuersions wondrous ioy receiue what passing ioy will be and delectations when all the members to their head shall cleaue and for short sorrowes endlesse recompence receiue my muse her selfe eun out of breath now flys raisd vp so high by ioy spirituall yet by ioys obiects she must higher rise to father sonne the holy ghost and all what greater ioy than on the father call and how did abraham reioyce to see the day of his redeemers nuptiall ah what more ioy vnspeakeable can bee than feele the holy spirit of grace to dwell in thee oh happy host such guests to entertaine with peace of

faire and branch on eury side but this did faith but temporary breed and we this but a momentany ioy areed there are besides this friendly seeming ioy other that are professed enemys as those which worldly happinesse enioy and liue in pleasures ease and jollitys against these thauthor of true ioy replys woe vnto you that laugh for you shall waile lament and howle for your iniquitys when iudgement comes and all mens hearts shal faile what then shall all your worldly pleasures you auaile another ioy against true ioy i find when in true cause of ioy we so delight that we omit from lusts

alone who is all worthinesse but in thy selfe is none as those which vaine applause of men regard and at their doing almes a trumpet blow gaine onely praise of men for their reward but god no such goodworkes will euer know so those in whom these boasting merits flow and in their meritorious workes delight god neuer them doth this sound comfort show they may awhile seeme goodly in mans sight but neuer feele true inward ioy and sound delight as those which onely see the stars and moone but neuer saw faire phaebus glorious light beleeue no cleerer lights haue euer shone than those faire lamps which doe adorne the night so those that neuer knew this true delight those heaunly ioys to holy saints confind thinke there most ioy where flesh doth most delight but tast they once sweet inward ioy of mind in all these worldly ioys they no content can find this heaunly ioy by no similitude in heaun or earth can truly be exprest yet is shee felt as oft in simple rude as in the most profound deepe learned breast none know her till they be of her possest for as we feele the winde when it doth blow but whence it comes or where it meanes to rest no wit of man ere able was to show so many feele these ioys but know not whence they flow as in the incarnations mysteries the blessed virgin ouershadowed by th holy ghost and power of the most high perceiud her fruitfull womb replenished but knew not whence till th angell it aread so wee this babe of ioy spirituall oft feele in vs most liuely quickened but know not how nor whence the same doth fall till that same spirit of truth to vs reuealeth all and as no creature able is of man the spirit to discerne but man alone so of this spirituall ioy no spirit can conclude but this sweet spirituall holy one some would it liken to the glorious sunne which by his liuely beames doth life inspire where they an obiect fit to light vpon but i forbeare too nicely to inquire and rather in mine heart to feele her beames desire oh sunne of

brides ornaments meditat i of wisdome and prvdence the first degree to wisdome is the misse of folly for as darknesse the priuation is of lights being but no being is so folly is of wise illumination and as in chaos rude at first creation there was all darknesse by the want of light so in all men before their renouation are follys mists and errours blackest night till there the spirit moue which all things doth inlight the poets which did wondrously transcend in making mysterys by fictions plaine all other graces as diuine commend but wisdome they to be a goddesse faine minerva who proceedeth from the braine of iupiter whom they the mistris hight of all the graces and the muses traine to whom shee oft descends for her delight wearyd with toile of gouernment and martiall fight thus her of warre peace politie and arts they goddesse make as if they should her call the wisdome god the father thus imparts vnto the sonne to make rule order all with god the father coessentiall as all his

of wisdome excellent the whilst i sing these radiant rayes of thine which make a mortall wight seeme gloriously diuine what and how great is wisdomes heaunly skill no heart of man is able to conceiue much lesse expresse by any tongue or quill for none but wisdome wisdome can perceiue the cause vnknowne of nothing shee doth leaue a numen of such wondrous excellence shee doth no good but from her selfe receiue being her owne end ayme and recompence no good in heaun or earth but flows from sapience and therefore calld the proper good of ioue which though to men and angells hee dispence in wise proportion yet from him doth moue all wisdome and to him hath reference for as in power so in sapience he doth all other heaunly powers transcend for wisdome ground is of omnipotence and as we mortalls on her hests attend so neerer io diuine perfection we ascend such is true wisdoms glory that eun they seeme much to doubt who doe her most admire whither we properly possesse her may and by continuall industry acquire or that the heauns her secretly inspire in briefe no price or gold can her obtaine shee seemes to be some flame of heaunly fire in adam breathd before by folly slaine which therefore we must seeke to haue from heaun againe schooles her to be the knowledge doe define of things diuine and humane which in breast of mortalls if it pure and liuely shine makes him like god vnmoud and stable rest for as no chance of fortune can molest the power diuine so wisemen doe enioy within themselues by wisdome peace and rest nothing that is without can them annoy all seeming miseries giue place to inward ioy yet falls this wisdome short of that diuine which adam did possesse before his fall and as sunbeames through clouds so doth she shine through our corruptions scarse discernd at all wee common and more exquisite her call that see things that are past and things in sight this things which in succeeding times may fall wee her as shee guides mens affayres aright call prudence wisdome as shee doth in god delight wisdome and prudence in an humane breast are one same grace though diuers by relation wisdome referres to god prudence doth rest most in a wise and vpright moderation of states and men by laws administration by wisdome here we see the life of grace by prudence in a ciuill conuersation prudence amongst the heathen had a place true heaunly wisdome only gods elect doth grace this heaunly wisdome whereby we conuerse with god and take delight in holy things doth our affections all and wills peruerse set right and neere diuine perfection brings shee first like good musitian tunes the strings and then sends forth a most harmonious sound first lifts our soules to heaun vpon her wings next orders all by prudence on the ground like leach who ere he others cure himselfe makes sound she first within in order sets the heart next is for outward things most prouident no grace more good to mortalls doth impart nor none more euills here on earth preuent she shews her inward graces god hath lent by outward manners habit graue attire few words pure hands in all such complement such gesture publike and in her retire as all her for a heaunly patterne doe admire but most of all a wiseman striues to tame both in himselfe and others sin and lust for hee that good from ill discerns doth blame false varnisht shows defild with inward rust he pride pompe boasting scorne away doth thrust and from a pure serenity of mind a paterne draws of life most quiet iust far from opinions false and errour blind and guides at sterne as in a calme so in the wind in warre most valiant in iudgement iust ill vnto good things hurtfull turns to sound wills still the same because the best no gust of fate oppresleth him if wealth abound or pouertie he still the same is found and doth with pleasing constancy endure all fortunes changes which doe others wound true innocent sincere iust simple pure and as his life his death is ioyfull sweet secure the poets faine that in the golden age graue wise experiencd men bare all the sway and the vnexpert young not yet growne sage to learne laws rules first practisd to obey for prudence all by leuell orders ay and by a long experience doth discerne how she prouide for future changes may by precept and example much we learne but that imprints most deepe which doth our selues concern examples precepts and experience are euer ready at a wisemans hand to teach him iudgement counsell prouidence of which we always here in need doe stand by counsell we the grounds doe vnderstand of things we ought to doe or leaue vndone iudgement our wills and senses doth command what things we ought embrace and what to shun and prouidence prouides for things that are to come i praise not here that cunning politie which maketh of anothers folly gaine this comes of malice guile and subtiltie which generous braue prudence doth disdaine such always euill counsell entertaine the apes of prudence reasons deprauation whose minds as hands grow hard by taking paine are by base plots and subtill magination inured vnto others wrongs and supplantation as quicknesse wit as soundnesse memory graue lookes the face and plainnesse speech commend so iudgements praise is in equalitie without least doing wrong to foe or friend and as salt sauours so doth iudgement bend eun all our words thoughts workes to good or ill without this iudgement prudence doth intend nothing for shee is mistresse of her will which she with all her power labours to fulfill counsell and iudgement are the very eyes and lamps here to direct a prudent mind which they who want or foolishly misprise walke on in folly and in errour blind we many ignorant vaine fooles doe find so wise in their conceit and estimation they thinke all wisdome in their breasts confind these being bound by double obligation to folly theres no hope of any reformation prudence and folly in the soule of man like health and sicknesse in his body are as health the body keepes so prudence can the soule deliuer from the deuills snare and as diseases here the thread doth share of bodys life so folly soone doth rend the soule with pleasures vaine and worldly care for as strong men within a fort defend so prudent thoughts our soules from satans fury shend and as among the noble senses fiue the sight doth all the rest in worth excell because all doe their light from her deriue and shee all that offends them doth repell so prudence all the vertues doth precell because by light god sends her from aboue shee counsells all the graces to do well for without her no grace aright can moue prudence of all the rest the gouernour doth proue vlisses prudence aiax fortitude whilst they each other doe accompany win citys conquer men and monsters rude but if they square for gaine or dignity and aiax leaues vlisses company his valour turnes to folly or to rage so men of greatest magnanimity when they the guidance leaue of prudence sage grow beastly mad or foolish in their later age i may her liken to the prince of day from whom all lesser lamps doe borrow light who when he doth his glorious beames display the rest all seeme to be extinguisht quite so when as heaunly wisdome wondrous bright her selfe amongst the graces doth disclose they all doe seeme to vanish in her sight as all the glory that they haue arose dispose from those bright beames which wisdome doth on them as god the world the emperour his host the gouernour his ship the sunne the day and as the bodys ruled by the ghost so doth faire prudence all the vertues sway and as these like good guides direct the way vnto their charge to reach their proper end so doth true wisdome all that her obey to endlesse happinesse and pleasure send most happy man who doth her holy hests attend may his heart die like nabals churle and foole or like achitophel end with a string laugh in the stocks cleaue to the scorners stoole that listens not to heaunly counselling of wisdome and her sweet admonishing shee hath prouided victualls powrd out wine sent out her maids vs to the feast to bring to bid those that seeke knowledge come and dine and those that prudence want to tast her grapes diuine for shees the vine whose grapes yeeld pleasing smell whose fruit and flowers wealth life honour are the garden where christ dearest spouse doth dwell planted with all the herbs and spices rare which to adorne his church he doth prepare would thou one word which should her worth containe he hath true wisdome who the lord doth feare and who knows holy things doth entertaine right vnderstanding without this the rest are vaine she as the prince or generall doth guide all other graces in loues sacred band doth order marshall and for them prouide as th eye which all the members doth command the gouernours of men of cities and of families and each mans priuate state she orders wisely by her prudent hand and they that duely on discretion waite command the stars and rule eun ouer time and fate as shadows more directly opposite to sunnes bright rayes seeme short by being neere when those which are much farther from the light more goodly faire and long by farre appeare so who small knowledge haue attained here thereof doe always make a greater show than those whose vnderstanding shining cleare doe all the paths of heaunly wisdome know for with true wisdome always humblenesse doth grow and as gods wisdome doth no lesser seeme in smallest creatures as a gnat or fly than greater so we ought no lesse esteeme wisemen in low degree then dignitie the snaile a mirrour is of politie who with her hornes keepes always sentinell and neuer commeth out before shee try if things without be all in peace and well else she retyring home liues quiet in her shell oh sonnes of men that you could but behold the wondrous beauty of this heaunly peare but nought on earth her beauty can vnfold her glory in the heauns doth shine most cleare in all gods workes her splendour doth appeare she first from heaun vouchsafed to descend to liue in iudah with her chosen deare but now her beames more ample doe extend to all the nations of the earth she light doth lend she taught our father that was made alone to raise himselfe to glory from his fall but enuy turnd from her his foolish sonne and made by fratricide and fury fall loe when the floud the world destroyed all she it preserues by one wise worke of wood the dead sea yet is the memoriall of foolish citys fiue which there erst stood where she saud lot from fire as noah from the sloud to tell what wonders haue beene by her wrought were too to long for this short meditation they in gods booke are easily found if sought for there indeed is wisdoms commendation where she vs doth with wary obseruation vnto the cony and the pismire send to learne to get our food and habitation whose meaner wisdome if we must attend much more wise heathens sayings most diuinely pend one being asked who was most wise replyd he that sinnd least when one of them desird to learne who was for youth the trustiest guid he answerd prudence and ins sonne requird only three things which he in youth admird in his tongue silence prudence in his mind shamefastnesse in his face when one requird how he the greatest in the least might find he answerd prudent thoughts in humane breast confind this was an ethnick but how doth she shine when she is ioynd with pure simplicitie when as that holy wisdome serpentine combines with douelike true sincerity oh thus the saints by holy subtilty walke safe amongst worlds crooked generation thus walkd our sauiour in humilitie and though the wicked plot his condemnation yet neuer could they touch him but by subornation oh how should we that haue this mirrour bright this sun of wisdome labour here to shine like stars which from the sun receiue their light and to sincerity true columbine ioyne this wise holy prudence serpentine vs to conduct through this worlds wildernesse and a most safe and perfect way out line through iordans waues to land of happinesse where mansions ready built we shall for ay possesse and vineyards planted whence the cananite for wicked treason gainst his maiesty god hath expelld to hell and darkest night proud lucifer and all his company oh why shouldst thou aduance base dust so high whose earthly mansion keepes his spirit low and will not let his vnderstanding flye to see what goodly clusters there doe grow in heaunly canaan where milke and hony flow we hardly here of things below discerne and with great paines what is before vs find ah how shall we than able be to learne thy wisdome which no limits haue confind thy spirit onely can into our mind these hidden mysteries in christ reueale in which the princes of the world were blind for from man naturall thou dost conceale this wisdome spirituall which thou to thine dost deale for as none knows the spirit of a man but that same spirit that within doth dwell so nothing apprehend this wisdome can but that wise spirit that all truth doth tell oh sacred spirit of truth my heart compell this holy sapience to entertaine thou only giust to drinke of wisdoms well mans wisdoms wickednesse his thoughts are vaine his knowledge is but errour and his pleasure paine thou didst create eun all things by thy word and by thy heaunly wisdome didst ordaine man of thy handy workes to be the lord that he in truth and equitie might raigne and with an vpright heart the right maintaine oh therefore downe thine heaunly wisdome send me in all truth and vprightnesse to traine she shall my words and works to thee commend and bring my small beginnings to a perfect end and here with praise and prayer i will end oh who aright can know or vnderstand except thou wisdome from thy throne dost send to giue vnto him what thou dost command then grant me wisdome always to withstand hells subtill plots and worlds base blandiments let sacred prudence euer be at hand still to direct my words acts and intents to yeeld obedience to thy commandements meditat ii of obedience when first th almighty by his only word had fashiond all within the firmament he made man last to be their king and lord that he to him might be obedient but man not with this monarchy content diuide his homage to omnipotence and hauing but one small commandement transgressed it by disobedience the easier the command the greater the offence this all the sonnes of adam doe deriue from him and call it guilt originall which by th eternall law did vs depriue of all gods benefits and did enthrall to endlesse bondage till christ for this fall the price of his most precious bloud did pay which vs recouers from sins actuall and by obeying gods whole law doth stay his wrath and merits heaun for all that him obay for as by first mans disobedience on all men commeth death and condemnation so by the seconds true obedience we haue eternall life and sure saluation thus disobedience by deriuation from adam bringeth endlesse wretchednesse and true obedience by imputation conuays from christ eternall happinesse so by the first comes sin by second righteousnesse the glorious robe of perfect righteousnesse which they that are obedient onely weare to couer that foule shame and wickednesse which adams disobedience layed bare ah let a disobedient sinner dare the aid of the obedient lamb desire my will and actions tongue and heart to square in due proportion to his heaunly squire whilst i of true obedience prayses doe enquire deuoutest lady handmaid to the queene of heaunly loue and so in duty bound that shees always prest and ready seene to doe what thing soeuer she propound her heart words will and deeds all one are found seruing for loue and not for feare or gaine no subiect merits better to be crownd for who can best obay he best can raigne and she is shortly sure eternall crownes to gaine if i may square her by the rules of art i her define to be our wills subiection to him that ought to rule both will and heart and by his will disposeth our best affection the rule of reason may be our direction how our superiours statutes we obay but when the lord commands theres no election nor doubting what we ought to doe or say gods wills the rule of right which none may disobey here in two branches i might her diuide obedience first to god and secondly to our superiours that on earth abide but all is but to one authority for theres no power or precedency but that which highest power doth ordaine who therefore doth resist mans soueraignty gods ordinance resisteth and againe who duly it obays gods statutes doth maintaine thus must our hearts eares hands be all attent his word and will in all things to obey who ouer vs hath lawfull regiment which is one god eternall blest for ay whose seruants all we are and therefore may not chuse a lord or master whom we will nor serue two masters least we disobay the one when we the others mind fulfill for that which pleaseth one doth crosse the others will thus our obedience is only due to him that all did for his seruice make and tis a firme position sound and true god only for himselfe but for his sake all that from him authoritie doe take we truly and sincerely ought obey or else our bounden dutie we forsake as those which doe their princes disobey when they their lawfull officers commands gainsay for this whole world is like a family in all things well and iustly ordered where god hath the supreame authority and rulers theirs from him deliuered by which they doe command as in his stead who then to them are disobedient they may be said to disobey the head for whilst they rightly vse their gouernment we ought them to obey in things indifferent indeed all ought regard the supreme will as first commanding cause and end of all which all that being haue ought to fulfill from which as all things rise so all must fall here therefore first we into mind will call to whom that will commands vs to obay for in obeying their commands we shall obey that supreme will this is the way to make gods will the cause of all we doe or say to him we must be subiect first of all to whom all power in heaun and earth is lent the sonne of god begotten naturall next to his ministers which he hath sent apostles pastors doctors here are meant which by his word doe teach their masters will and rule his church by godly gouernment and those which heare these his commands fulfill and those which them despise despise his heaunly will as kings which with great honour doe conuay princes ambassadours it doe intend vnto their lords so we our lord obay when we obey the legates he doth send the second power is that which god doth lend to kings and princes for to delegate iudges to punish those which doe offend and to maintaine the life peace and estate of eury member that maintaines the bodies state to this all subiects owe obedience the third obedience is which wife doth owe vnto her head who due beneuolence for dutie ought vnto his wife to shew for as the church so ought the wife to know her due subiection vnto her head and as our christ directs his church below so wiues must be by husbands ordered but this of wiues is better knowne then practised so is th obedience which children owe vnto their parents by commandement and promise they shall long and good days know if they to them will be obedient the fift and last is masters gouernment and seruants duty which they should them beare which ought to be with single true intent not for eyeseruice wages or for feare but as they would obey eun christ their master deare thus ought we to obey these fiue degrees set ouer vs because we so obay the highest power and if their iust decrees we sleight that highest power we disobay far wide then disobedient spirits stray which by religion would all reuerence exclude due vnto magistrates and say they vnto no man owe obedience a false excuse of schisme and all vnreuerence obedience preserueth vnity and helpeth to this great worlds conseruation as heauns and earth doe by due obsequy obey their glorious makers ordination behold how all things in this worlds creation doe by their makers order stand or moue earth keepes her center for mans preseruation the heauns turne all in motion round aboue without obedience one would out another shoue and thus we may obedience obserue to hold our members in due motion ay whilst one doth to another member serue and all vnto the spirit doe obay the soule of man which doth by reason sway eun all the members to their preseruation and if the least of them doe disobay shee either seekes their better reformation or one endangers all to endlesse condemnation for whilst man here doth on the earth remaine sin and corruption in his body dwell seeking therein as lord and king to raigne but grace doth striue by force them to expell if bondslaues we our selues to sin doe sell and giue our members here lusts to obay we yeeld vnto such lusts as lead to hell but if that grace our soule aright doth sway then all the members follow her the narrow way remoue this vertue of obedience from soule or body subiect city towne or from the creatures wanting life and sense and all vnto confusion tumble downe the tower of babel might to heaun haue growne had all obayd with mutuall diligence but suddainly we see it ouerthrowne when to obay they want intelligence for without vnderstanding no obedience as to maintaine heauns perfect vnitie all to one surpeame trinity obay so all that haue with it affinitie subiect themselues to that one god for ay no wonder if those that him disobay to many errours schismes and sects doe fall for one true vnity they doe gainsay when they resist his ordinances shall and disobey gods word that here directeth all mee thinkes my muse could here her selfe transcend by musing of th obedience aboue which from the sonne to father doth ascend and angells who obeying feare and loue alas what can th eternall power moue obedience of poore wretches to require but vs to ioyne to christ our head in loue as he is ioynd to god in due desire vnto no other end obedience doth aspire for as when in a wild and fruitlesse stocke we doe some noble impe inoculate the fruit erst base and wild like to the blocke is made as goodly faire and delicate as tree which first this imp did generate so the least imp of christs obedience in vs ingraft doth vs regenerate and makes vs beare fruit of like excellence as liuely tree from which it first had influence for all that from stocke of first adam come beare those sowre fruits of disobedience but all that doe ingraft againe become in second adams true obedience bring forth sweet fruits like liuely tree from whence they haue receiued first their sap to spring swee liuing vine whose sacred influence vs makes obedient to our lord and king ah who the praises of thy noble fruit can sing it did aduance that holy prophets quill when he in volume of the booke did find written that thou shouldst gods whole law fulfill whereto thou wert withall thine heart inclind and when the time was come thereto assignd thou wert obedient to all gods will performing it with all thine heart and mind evn till the iewes thee on the crosse did kill when thou resistedst not though they thy bloud did spill obedient lamb this was the sacrifice the offering god did for sin require thus we must offer vp to god likewise our soules and bodys with like zealous fire to dye if not indeed yet in desire quick holy acceptable offering to pacifie gods iustice and his ire is when to him obedient hearts we bring and crucifie those lusts which from our flesh doe spring as from the boundlesse ocean doe run all streames which doe returne into the maine so from one paterne of obedience come all ours and thither doth returne againe the lamb that was from worlds beginning slaine gaue the first blow to disobedience which isaack imitates when he is laine on altar to be sacrificed thence whom truly abram offerd by obedience this was that quiet sauour god did smell when offring one of each cleane bird and beast the good old noah pleasd the lord so well obedience was the seasoning to the feast what made the lord sauls sacrifice detest but that he did his word then disobey when he did spare of amalec the best to offer vp but therein did obay his own corrupt inuentions not what god did say better then sacrifice is to obay and then the fat of rams to giue good eare happy though we doe all the world gaine say if we obay our lord and master deare but ah whilst we remaine as pilgrims here flesh world and deuill daily vs perswade to follow pleasures vaine and to forbeare obedience to the lord which vs hath made whose statutes to obey should be our onely trade oh sacrifice of fooles with tongue to pray but harbour no obedience in thine heart who dost in word professe god to obay but by thy workes dost all his laws peruert behold it is not without iust desert that beasts to thee are disobedient when thou to god a faithlesse rebell art to whom obey sun moone stars firmament nor sea against his will inuades the continent whilst i about this sinfull body beare lusts and corruptions will therein remaine yet neuer let them so much domineere as here of grace the mastery to gaine for if i suffer sinne in me to raigne that all my members will to sinne obay that sin whereof saint paul doth so complaine oh who me from the same deliuer may it is not i but sin that christ doth disobay if that the iudge by his authoritie inioyne me to performe or speake a thing against the will of soueraigne maiestie here my deniall no offence doth bring and if i be commanded by the king to doe against his will that is aboue i here no rebell am though suffering for i were better crosse and prison proue than in gehenna fry from whence is no remoue and as in all humane societies the meaner power the greater doth obay till to the peramount it doth arise which power all inferiour powers sway so in this power spirituall we may behold like order for obedience the peramount is gods high power ay for though we doe all powers reuerence yet to the highest we haue always reference what more vniust than looke to be obayd by our inferiours and to disobay those god hath placd aboue vs for our aid ah how thy will be done may we here pray as angells doe the same in heaun for ay which we so often crosse by doing ill more often then are minutes in a day oh let my heart be ready to fulfill mine heart be ready lord to learne and doe thy will ready in all things lawfull to obay superiours all to doe things iust and right to loue my neighbour for mine enemys pray grace to embrace and with corruptions fight to cast off earthly things and to delight wholly in god and heaunly contemplation to worke by day to watch and pray by night to learne of christ meeknesse humiliation with trembling and with feare to worke out my saluation since i must be obedient to the end how should i end to beg obedience obedience which to liberty doth tend and vs restores vnto that excellence which adam lost by disobedience let others glory in their mightie traine and large command of many continents by meeknesse and obedience i shall gaine with meeke obedient lamb in heaun for ay to raigne meditat iii of meeknesse as in faire garden where variety of choisest flowers the senses to delight are plact by cunning hand most curiously their diuers colours most effect the sight that broad and fairest shew and stand vpright but oft we find low creeping on the ground an hearb whose odour sweet doth more inuite our smells than all the tuslips there are found so is it with this grace which i doe next propound for though the goodliest garden of the bride like eden is so faire embelished with richest fruits and flowers from side to side their names and hues cannot be numbered much lesse their force and natures be aread and though all are more glorious to be seene than meeknesse which is next disciphered yet none more pleasing to our smell i weene nor more than her respected of loues royall queene obedience meeknesse and humility are flowers more for profit than for show pleasing the smell and taste more than the eye and lowly like sweet thyme and hysope grow these by the outward face we must not know their inward vertue tis that we esteeme their force is heaunly though their dwellings low and may the greatest monarch here beseeme for sure the king of kings like these himselfe did deeme and vs commandeth all of him to learne meeknesse and lowlinesse which rest doth bring eternall rest which doth our soules concerne here more than any vaine and worldly thing most mighty god and yet the meekest king fit thou my soule for this sweet meditation and teach me meeknesse whilst i meeknesse sing which base and meane in mans vaine estimation is with the lord of lords of highest valuation some her define to be a moderation of anger and would haue her to abstaine from all reuengefull furious enuious passion thereby possession of her soule to gaine for who doth gentle meeknesse entertaine with her finds happy peace and quiet rest and who from furious rage will not refraine but harbours wrath and malice in his brest possesseth not himselfe but is by them possest meeke gentle milde soft affable and kind in words though diuers are in sense the same and come from gentle habit of the mind which like it selfe our words and acts doth frame making wild sauage furious creatures tame for all are mad and wild since adams fall and burne in furious and reuengfull flame but meeknesse mitigates appeasing all and blessed here in peace the earth inherit shall meeknesse which pleaseth god and profits man for god the meeke exalteth to saluation and those which here abstaine from anger can in multitude of peace haue delectation with meeke far better is humiliation than greatest spoiles with proud ones to diuide heaunly hierusalems no habitation for those which right by duells doe decide but those which can with meeknesse iniurys abide she ire and rancour in her heart can brooke but doth all with an equall mind sustaine prouokd by none nor doth she one prouoke though oft offended hurteth none againe she doth from all improbity abstaine resists not euill but the same with good still ouercomes and doth more glory gaine by gentle yeelding than if she withstood the wicked in his raging furious angry mood oh grace most glorious when god her sends to dwell in breast of some great potentate his heart she from all crueltie defends and though he be a lord of life and fate his hands with bloud doth not contaminate she such a prince to heaun at length will bring too soone for vs though he may thinke it late let homer fierce achilles praises sing giue me a mercifull meeke mild and gentle king for meeknesse brings more honour to a king than purple scepter diademe or crowne and richer triumphs doth to emperours bring than winning any castle fort or towne he gets eternall glory and renowne who can by meeknesse bridle passions right let tyrants rage and let the furys frowne they can no more a good meeke man affright than arrows hurt the water that thereon doe light inhumane crueltys taught in the schoole of satan who would like himselfe haue all but he whose seats in heaun and his footstoole vpon the earth before whose presence fall downe all the angells and him maker call bids vs like to himselfe be meeke and low for he that turnd to sweet that cup of gall can make the meeke and lowly highest grow and with one blast the proud and cruell ouerthrow i labour not to keepe downe or depresse that humane natures high sublimitie without which creatures beare no awfulnesse nor due respect vnto the maiesty god hath annexed to mans soueraignty i seeke to suit his mind and conscience vnto his outward grace and dignity and raise him by an inward confidence of welknowne worth to an angelike excellence yet not by this sublimity to swell beyond the bounds of mortalls he thats wise will as his worth and due deserts excell be still more low and humble ins owne eyes and as his state and honour here doe rise hee is more modest gentle meeke and kind preferring not himselfe in any wise before his equalls thus he grace doth find by gentle manswetude with god and all mankind for whilst by an obsequious conuersation and by ingenuous manners pleasing sweet far from base flattery as vaine ostentation hee doth inferiours equalls betters greet by loosing of his owne lo he doth get in others thoughts the highest estimation his heads in heaun though on the earth his feet and by anothers vertues veneration he getteth of his owne all loue and admiration oh happy man to whom heauns king hath sent this grace to be the glory of the rest what can that mind molest or discontent that harbours gracious meeknesse in his brest they that can contumely faire disgest if any them deride or reprehend streight of themselues take more seuere inquest if ought be iustly blamd they soone amend if false it neuer them shall anger or offend meeke gentle patient bearing right or wrong from inward free as outward perturbation reuenge is not a thing that doth belong to her she finds far greater contentation in wrongs dissembling and their tolleration the wants which she within her selfe doth find her more depresse by modest moderation than all her vertues eleuate her mind as salt she sauours all the vertues in their kind this is the same or very like the grace which we doe call christian humilitie without which other vertues haue no place all are in her as in an vnitie she is the surest way to dignitie the center where all vertues lines doe meet most honourd when she most doth vilifie her selfe and when she stoops to wash saints feet the highest king of kings with kisses her doth greet yet none of worldlings is esteemd more vile they it account a thing too meane and base here to discend vnto so low a stile they thinke that meeknesse valour doth disgrace but oh absurd presumptuous mortall race so high and proud in thine owne estimation what things created in more wretched case weake vaine precipite and on each occasion ready to fall from highest hopes to desperation what is thy body but fraile quickned clay thy soules so clouded with obscurity it is most ready prone precipite ay to fall to basenesse errour vanity happy who sees his owne infirmity thus by discending only we ascend vnto the highest humane dignity first step to honour is to vilipend our selues let others thee and not thy selfe commend none seekes to pull his foot out of the mire vntill he feeles and knows that it is in nor none to wash the durt off doth desire vntill he sees it cleaue vnto his skin so till this grace vs shews our selues within we neuer seeke those heaunly remedies to purge our soules from error and foule sinne this was of all the oracles most wise first know thy selfe that is thine owne infirmities thus comes the purest wheat from foulest ground so it be first well tilld and harrowed and thus the ignorant grow men profound when they their folly haue discouered of all the vertues can be reckoned the roots are bitter fruits most sweet doe proue selfe pride and arrogance once settled in humane brest most hard are to remoue this worke belongs to meeknesse humblenesse and loue most pleasant fruits which from this root do spring when weeding out base pleasures false and vaine she true delight into their roomes doth bring and rich content for euer to remaine happy who can this ladys fauour gaine shee able is and ready to defend against soules troubles and the bodys paine the meeke that patiently on god attend are sure to haue a joyfull quiet happy end nothing can his most noble mind appall which is with such tranquillity indude crosses afflictions may him here befall but base or abiect thoughts cannot intrude into a mind of such an habitude certaine his breast all vertues doth containe who hath this gentle vertue manswetude who wants her boasts of vertue but in vaine they are but shews of vertue which with him remaine it is the height of folly to bewray desire where we haue no power to offend so beat the sea if it will not obay or winds which crosse the way thou dost intend so whom thou canst not reach his picture rend such wounds make arrows when they cleane the aire yet many thus with rage their spirits spend were it not better farre to beare them faire but folly cannot beare though thou in morter bray her if an asse kicks thee must thou kicke againe or barks a dog wilt thou straight baule and cry because ones foolish canst thou not refraine but needs doe that is ill for company let fooles scorne meane birth want deformity this if a fault not thine thy makers is to him thats meeke no infelicity can fall by fortunes bitter frownes or blisse he counts them not his owne true vertues only his i liken meeknesse to that peece of wood wherewith the prophet did the fountaines heale and made the bitter waters sweet and good for so doth meeknesse with afflictions deale she all their bitternesse with ioy doth seale evn that accursed death vpon a tree she turneth from a curse vnto our weale blest are the meeke that for welldoing be hangd thereupon from thence they paradise may see a meeke mans minds like solitary place where all is quiet fit for contemplation and to behold his makers will and grace spending his time in sweetest meditation but cruell minds are full of perturbation like to a market or tumultuous faire where all is filld with noise and molestation durt in the streets strong clamours in the aire such places are vnfit for graces sweet repaire a meeke minds like vnto pernassus hill through whose pure aire shines phoebus golden ray whose siluer channells purest fountaine fill and all the meades bedeck with lillys gay the gardens with faire flowers adorned ay and when the brookes doe murmur any sound with much delight sweet zephirus doth play and all the birds vpon the trees around consort with muses nine to make a heavnly sound but a meeke mind more pleasing is then all these flowers fruits or musickes sweet delight no fit of fury can that heart appall for as a dart may on the water light and hurts it not by any force or might so force not fury can meeke mind offend for it giues way as doth the water light oh happy quiet mind that doth attend with meeknesse on gods bounteous goodnesse to the end as when the glorious sunbeames doe appeare all misty cloudinesse is turnd to day so where this grace the heart of men doth cheare all passions turbulent are driun away then mecknesse most her glory doth display when shee hath iustest cause to take offence no valour like this dames behold we may nor any like her modest patience a meeke and lowly mind excells all ornaments as when the lord of all to vs did come in humane flesh he peace and concord bred twixt men and angells and made all become as one in peace and quiet in their head so where this meeknesse doth her grace dispred there nations neighbours kindred all we find lately at discord now fast fettered in loue and friendships bands which firmly bind no surer band of loue than meeke and gentle mind in golden age when as the poets faine men beasts fish foule to be at amity this lady mecknesse as a queene did raigne and vnder loue had all authoritie but since the iron age which enmity hath raisd in eury riuer towne and field shee hath resignd her place of soueraigntie to iustice and delights now more to yeeld than scepters in age so turbulent to weeld and for she knows the noble gentle mind most sensible of wrong and iniury and few or none can here so constant find as to dissemble foule indignity she all requests that loue her company occasions to auoid and not inuite which may prouoke least iarre or simulty aed not like teachy curres to barke and bite or frogs which poets faine with bulrushes to fight if thus they cannot as who ay can here auoid some iniurys of them that reigne they must dissemble and with pleasing cheere what they can no wayes shift faire entertaine one askd how such old age he did attaine in court replyd by bearing iniurys sometimes remitting and sometimes againe for them gaue thankes thus surely he thats wise by suffring beares and not prouokes indignities and since no earthly powers so great and firme but iniury sometimes will dare to smite let wisdoms precepts so thee ay confirme thou neuer swerue from rules of reason right so armd the wrongs which on thine armor light shall backe on him that sent the same rebound but whom vnarmd she can prouoke to fight though happily they thinke her to confound they sure are to receiue a deepe and festring wound he stands not right whom iniury can bow who ill beare old doe on them new inuite but he that beares the old with patience how shall any new be able him to smite he that is wise and valiant scornes her might and by braue bearing doth her spite confound he best orecomes that sets by her most light who by impatience addes is like him found that doth by rending make incurable his wound in many wrongs tis better to be mute than by repeating them oft very small to cause long trouble or a tedious suit whilst all the shame doth on thauenger fall such better were not mentioned at all inuoke the helpe of constant patience whose presence doth all iniurys appall and with an equall mind beares all offence or doth despise them in her guiltlesse conscience thus many offring doe no iniurys because they are not so conceivd or taken oh happy who all wrong can so despise with sense thereof nere to be ouertaken whose vnmovd constant mind is neuer shaken so farre from muttring or least murmuring he laughs and smiles to see them so mistaken nors only easie in their pardoning but passeth by them without least acknowledging he is aboue the reach of iniuries who can represse reuenges curst desire and to the full repays his enemies who thus can quench wraths hot iniurious fire yet holy meeknesse leads vs a step higher happy who can ascend vnto such height it is the summity which all admire of highest vertue when we take delight all iniurys with benefits here to requite the jest is lost if it no laughter moue sos contumely if it be neglected he neuer will a valiant souldier proue to beare hot blows that is with words affected he sooner is with noisome smells infected who them with open nose doth entertaine than he that stops it or beares some selected preseruatiue for to defend his braine so tis to stop or ope our eares to proud disdaine poets paint scylla with a womans face but like a dog in neather parts and taile whom hercules th idea of all grace and vertue did amongst the monsters quaile you giue her life if you will heare her raile but shut her mouth with patient suffering or stop thine eares and soone her breath will faile here mecknesse ends and here i cease to sing shee doth more quiet rest than all the vertues bring meditat iiii gods word so mighty are the weapons manifold wherewith our spirituall foes doe vs assaile so many stratagems vs to infold so many terrours vaine our hearts to quaile that neither brestplate helmet shield or maile vs helpe against their forces can afford for if they close with vs they will preuaile therefore we must vnsheath our keenest sword our weapon spirituall evn gods most holy word which those that able are to wield aright of farre more force and liuely power find than all the weapons whereof poets write to haue beene wondrous powrfull in their kind what homer of achilles speare hath coynd i not vnfitly to this sword apply whose wounds to heale no balme could be assignd the speare that hurt must only remedy so whom this sword doth kill this sword must viuifie of wondrous weapons heathen poets tell of stygian armour and enchanted swords whereby small knights did monstrous gyants quell subdude and raigned ouer them as lords such fiction to vs good aduice affords against these gyants spirituall to fight our fleshly lusts and for to bind in cords our vaine affections here that take delight in doing that is wrong and leauing that is right god of all might that hast vs giun this sword not only spirituall battailes here to fight but dost engraue in it as on record thy rules whereby we muster may aright the lanthorne to our paths our feets best light direct my muse to sing i humbly pray of this thy word by holy words insight for but by it none can aright display that swords eternall power which sin and hell dismay that word which in beginning by a word of nothing made heaun earth and creatures all and was from all beginning god and lord doth not within my muses compasse fall that word whereof now meditate i shall is that reuealed written veritie which first and second testament we call both which were first declared mightily by wonders signes and miracles from god on high for as the lord most mighty wonders wrought by him that publikely did first record this sacred word and by his hand forth brought his sonnes from bondage of a cruell lord so those to whom he did this grace afford of publishing his later testament wrought mighty wonders by this mighty word to all beholders great astonishment confirming thus that they from god aboue were sent from whom this word hath all authority for by the holy spirits inspiration came law and gospell prophets history and all canonicall wise ordination the sacred light that giues illumination vntill the daystarre in our hearts arise whose heaunly wisdome breedeth admiration in all their hearts that are diuinely wise but folly seemes to such as sinne doth blind their eys and sure it is a mighty powrfull word if that the sense thereof be right applyd more keene than any sharpe two edged sword and eun the soule and spirit doth diuide by it are all our hearts intents descryd the ioynts and marrow it doth smite in sunder no creature from her sight it selfe can hide all high exalted things it bringeth vnder and gainst all disobedience soundeth out like thunder this was the sword wherewith our valiant head when he was tempted in the wildernesse and with a sixweekesfast sore weakened did free himselfe from hells malitiousnesse when first on him his enemy did presse he vsd the hilts himselfe for to defend but when he could not thus his foe represse loe he the point against his breast doth bend behind me satan all gods worship must attend those that will vse aright this holy word must not the letter but the sense apply or else they vse the scabbard for the sword wherewith none euer wun the victory it is the mystery of iniquitie to take the letter and to leaue the sense to forge of antichrists idolatry the feigned rocke the keys of heaun from whence he claimes to vniuersall power obedience a multitude of words but all one sense and tending all to that grand mystery to which all mysteries haue reference mans personall vnion with the deity the which to god was knowne infallibly in his election ere the worlds foundation and all the bookes it seemes to typifie from genesis vnto the reuelation sublime transcendent mysterys of mans saluation how should my muse these hope to comprehend in this short fainting breath of meditation which doth all humane wit and skill transcend whose each word hath an hid signification each letter pricke and point an obseruation all fauouring of wisdome true diuine and far beyond mans weake inuestigation in it such rare profound deepe learning shine a volume is not able to expound a line fie then on those that swolne with vaine ambition to sway all kingdomes with materiall sword preferre before this word their vaine tradition which nought but vainnesse like themselues afford their names be wiped out of the record and booke which all thy saints names doth containe that thus doe seeke to vilifie this word which to accomplish gods owne sonne was slaine and thousand martyrs spent their bloud it to maintain so deale with prophets that to hide conspire from simple people food spirituall which they as new borne babes do milke desire that they may grow vp to be strong and tall i grant as mothers breasts doe best of all nourish the child so doth gods holy word which from our motherchurches breasts doth fall best nourishment vnto her babes afford so as it be sincere else be it all abhord true angells food sweet manna pure diuine my spirits dayly bread and nourishment which wanting shee doth hunger statue and pine and yeeld to bodys sleshly regiment my soule with fat and marrow is content when i with ioyfull lips thy praises sing and feed upon thy lawes great wonderment which to subiection doth my body bring and makes the spirit rule and order like a king the spirit it compares to looking glasse where we our faces spots may all behold but soone out of our memory they passe like to a dreame or tale thats idlely told but who his mind thereon doth daily hold doth walke in perfect law of liberty which to him doth apparantly vnfold his soule and fleshes least deformity and sheweth him the meanes the same to rectifie eun as the raine indiffereutly doth fall vpon the fruitfull and the barren ground so preached is this heaunly word to all though to the faithlesse it be fruitlesse found oh where this word doth powerfully sound the strongest holds of sin it shatters downe and things most high exalted doth confound its smallestseed in lowly valley sowne est suddenly is to a mighty cedar growne it is reported of the siluer doue she neere the purest streames doth most delight in which shee may espy the shadow moue of towring faulcon or the rauenning kite whereby she is forewarnd to scape by flight from cruell hawkes that seeke her for a pray so if in spirituall streames we take delight our spirituall foes we there discouer may that so our soules forewarnd like doues might flye away most glorious sunshine where it doth enlight more comfortable light hath showne but when shee doth withdraw her beames is night and darknesse spirituall far grosser growne than that which three days was to pharaoh knowne hardhearted pharaoh thou that didst despise this word and all the wonders by it showne eun all thy plagues light on them that deuise to hide this heaunly light from simple peoples eys it is the doore whereby the pastours may spiritually ascend into their fold those that doe enter in another way we doe as rauenning wolues and robbers hold this words a touchstone which doth try from gold all mettalls base inuentions of mans braine of which such store at latium now are sold not for the flocks but for the shepheards gaine masse dirges pardons trentalls and traditions vaine nothing describe her nature better will than touchstone thvse of which simplest may learne but one had need of cunning goldsmiths skill true touchstone from a false one to discerne oh how did those noble berreans earne to try those things that paul deliuered the things which our saluation did concerne by that which in the scriptures they had read the scriptures that the spirit had canonized who from the simple people these doe hide deale as with israel did the cananite who no smith sufferd in their coasts tabide to make a weapon for an israelite therfore no speare nor sword when they should fight but in sauls hands and ionathans were found chams hellish pollicy most deulish sleight to hold in ignorance and bondage bold by taking way such helpes as liberty propound as first god by his word and spirit wrought and fashiond all things in this worlds creation so by this word and spirit he hath brought all things to passe in this our renouation and as he for our bodyes preseruation hath here materiall bread and wine prepard sos word and spirit is for sustentation of all our soules that rightly it regard such neuer need of thirst and hunger be afeard as appetites a signe of bodys health so of the soules is hunger of his word and as to him that seeketh store of wealth a myne can best what he desires afford so he that spirituall treasures vp would hoard come to this sacred word where he shall find it doth a world of mysterys record the richest jewells to adorne the mind true treasures no where else reuealed to mankind for its the megazine where pastours haue all gems and treasures to enrich their fold the storehouse whence they all abundance craue of liuing food their lambs in plight to hold the armory from whence they may he bold to fetch all armes and weapons to withstand the wolues which them infest and to vphold truth and the right against all satans band falfe heretickes base lusts and worlds encroaching hand but as the manna that from heaun was sent bred wormes if wrong but food if rightly vsed so breeds this word our soules due nourishment but neuerdying wormes if once abused he that for egypts fleshpots hath refused this heaunly food and mans tradition vaine his base false lying legends rather chused shall whilst this flesh betweene his jawes remaine be with his great and wealthiest chosen shauelings slain fountaine of liuing water which doth more and faster spring as it is emptied most fruitfull vine which bringeth still more store of heaunly grapes as they are gathered th epistle of heauns king which rightly read brings vs the gladsome tidings of saluation whose harder sense strong men may chuse as bread the plainer babes may suck for sustentation we both aright concort by heaunly meditation the sword that doth spiritually diuide from vs all manner of concupiscence our youths reformer and our ages guide transcending reason more than reason sence truths ground the fountaine of intelligence loues complement the root of humblenesse faiths hold the rule of all obedience hopes anchor and the path of rrighteousnesse the ladder which we climbe from hence to happinesse would you haue more it is the milke sincere which can alone quench hells eternall fire the only daughter to her mother deare the mystery which angells doe admire the sweetest song of blessed heaunly quire whose praise eun all the heaunly powers sing apostles prophets martyrs all desire with all their might to strike this lofty string which dauid in one psalme a thousand times doth ring as iacob with the angell wrestled nor let him goe without a blessing would so when words mysteries by vs are read we striue and struggle for the meaning should a goodly strife if we contending could hold out till what we seeke we doe obtaine as incense doth no pleasing smell vnfold nor spice till it be in a morter braine so are words mysteries till study makes them plaine this makes the lips of christs endeared bride than any hony combe to drop more sweet and vnderneath her daintiest tongue abide hony and milke the hony is most meet to heale the wounds sin makes from head to feet the milke for babes loe thus her either brest which like two twining roes doe equall meet yeeld most abundant food if softly prest and both with roses sweet and lillys faire are drest this is the tower of dauid which is built by thholy spirit of most costly stone whereon a thousand shields doe hang all guilt with swords and weapons for the mightiest one this is the priuie garden where alone the spouse with bridgroome doth her selfe delight planted with nardus saffron cinamon and all trees good for medicine tast or sight through which doth flow a well of liuing waters bright most heaunly paradise where tree of life my soule most heaunly fruits doth daily bring fit for the lamb to walke in with his wife and for the spouse most angelllike to sing the soueraigne grace and bounty of her king where though i often seeke to hide in vaine mee from my nakednesse discouering my blessed bridegroome calleth me againe and clothes me with the robes of lamb most righteous slaine there mannalike loe eury fruit doth tast iust as we would none iustly can complaine though his vnweeded garden lieth wast god send to good and bad alike his raine let him where thornes and bryers doe remaine take heed how he this heaunly deaw accuse it is the root thy euill heart and vaine which doth the sweetnesse of this raine abuse which for to water weeds and nettles doth it vse how should this word be sweet vnto the mouth wherein is nought but gall and bitternesse or how should heaunly deaws from west or south moisten that heart which by maliciousnesse more hardned is than flint in wickednesse alas what corne can sweetest raine forth bring in ground that choked is with worldlinesse where as the thornes vp with the wheat doe spring and from the root suck vp all heaunly nourishing evn as a lamp without supply of oyle being daily had is soone extinguished so though we seeme to prosper here awhile in faith and grace alls soone abolished vnlesse that they be daily nourished with hearing reading prayer meditation in vaine it with our mouths is vttered except it in our hearts makes habitation and we expresse it in our liues and conuersation oh let this holy words most heaunly fire my secret sound affections inflame and burne vp all vaine fleshly worlds desire oh blessed fire like that in bush did flame but neuer did consume or burne the same the fire whereby gold catholike is tride and straw and stubbled errour brought to shame in whom this inward fire doth ay refide he well the scorching heat of outward may abide but as no fleshly eys can here behold the glorious sunne but by that suns sweet sight so no man vnderstanding may be bold to know this word but where it doth enlight lord in thy light then let mee see this light whereby i may my sinfull life amend and in thy statutes set my whole delight and wholly in the ways of wisdome tend so shall my foot stand fast with ioy vnto the end for as the snow and raine from heavn descend but neuer thither doe returne againe till that be done for which thou didst them send to make the fruitfull soile fit for the graine so neuer shall thy word returne in vaine but sure accomplish what thou dost intend then moisten daily with this heavnly raine my hardned heart that all my powers may bend to glorifie thy name who dost these showers send how should he feare to want his daily food who with this word of life is nourished or who can thirst that drinketh of his bloud let not this word be vnderualued he that is with this heaunly manna fed eates of the fattest of gods spirituall store wherewith christs tender spouse is fostered till shee growes strong and faire to stand before her head and neuer thirst nor hunger any more this words eternall therefore hath no end i no beginning nor conclusion find i could herein my life and spirits spend it doth so feed my soule and glad my mind but now my muse to prayer is assignd and bows her knees to end her meditation with praise to him who first mine heart inclind to seeke this heaunly food of contemplation i hope vnto his glory and mine owne saluation meditat v of prayer as wise experiencd valiant generall whens souldier armed is from foot to head and hath at hand his shield and sword and all his armour with his belt fast buckled yet him into the battell will not lead till he be taught his sword aright to wield to take aduantages if offered and to defend his body with his sheild then him thus taught and traind he leads into the field so wee that in these spirituall battells fight not with fraile flesh but principalitys and powers of exceeding foce and might besides their treason plots and policies must first be taught in armes to exercise that all in complete armour ordered and taught how to assault our enemys they with our sword may be discomfited and we from hell and bondage safe deliuered i of this military art doe know no tutor like to holy supplication prayer who vse of all our armes doth show the serieant maior of our militation diuinest prayer holy meditation whereby with god we haue sweet conference about the mysteries of mans saluation and call the angells downe for our defence gainst fleshs worlds and deuils hostile violence prayer who though her knees bow in the dust yet are her vpper parts aboue the sky and doe into th almightys presence thrust to craue of all we want a new supply which like to clouds of incense vp doe flye if offered by his sonnes sweet mediation whose iust requests no father can deny oh offer mine then that this meditation may be directed by thy spirits illumination true prayer is the opening the desire evn of our heart and soule to god aright them powring out to him that doth require we should lay open all before his sight the sacrifice wherein he doth delight a sure defence to him that right doth pray the scourge wherewith we sin and satan smite and powers all and policies gainsay our surest refuge in each dangerous affray for christian souldier neuer kneeleth downe and lifts his heart vp

each part lest they him slay with greaues belt brestplate shield and helmet bright in faith hope patience truth and righteousnesse to fight by rules of art i prayer may diuide to these two heads thankesgiuing inuocation the second i in three doe subdiuide petition intercession deprecation first seekes gods glory and our owne saluation the second doth for others make petition so christ doth intercede by mediation by last we doe intreat for sins remission and be deliuerd from all ill and superstition but as the sauldier be he nere so strong well armd and skild in points of schooledefence if that his spirit faint is laid along so if we in our armes haue confidence and not relye on gods sole prouidence his spirit which helpeth our infirmities and doth instruct to pray with reuerence sending vp heart and soule by sighs and crys for all our armes and strength our foes will vs surprise for spirit is the cause efficient of all our prayers that to heavn ascend though faith be the internall instrument by which we all things aske doe apprehend with faith and spirit prayer heavn doth rend and whatsoeuer shee in christ his name doth aske the father downe to vs will send this pagans saw though otherwise to blame that christians nothing beg but they obtaine the same all blessings spirituall and temporall publike and priuate for our selues and friends all that in this life or a better fall to vs almighty god for prayer sends when heaun is shut vp that no dew descends if we forsake our sins and pray for raine the heaun on vs abundant showers spends though foes vs captiue from our citys traine yet prayer makes vs free and brings vs home againe if dearth drowth pestilence be in the land or citys be besiegd by enemies then if the cause thereof we vnderstand our sins and seeke by prayer remedy god will be mercifull accordingly yea if a stranger of an heathen nation doe call on god by prayer heartily and of his life doe seeke a reformation his prayer shall be heard by christ his mediation thus prayer is for all things profitable if her true obiect she doe neuer misse one god who gracious willing is and able and of our heart the only searcher is all things that are in heaun and earth are his we must no person in the deity omit when as we pray to him for blisse all workes externall in the trinity are one though their internall haue variety diuinest paternoster whose one word in it more heaunly matter doth containe than one whole hours babbling can afford suddaine abortiues of an idle braine with tedious turnings repetitions vaine out tumbling all that in their stomach lies which often goe beyond this prayers straine as if they were more feruent or more wise than he that for our patterne did it first deuise pure prayer made by serious meditation or by this holy patterne rightly pend briefe spirituall sublime ejaculation with feruent fury doth to heaun ascend and to the marke like swiftest arrow tend god is in heaun thou kneelest on the ground to him therefore no rash petitions send therein let matter more than words abound and inward sighs and groanes than outward plaints and sound but prayer though by thy two mighty wings of loue and meeknesse thou to heaun canst sore and come in presence of the king of kings by pardning wrongs and giuing to the poore presume not on thy merits ere the more that brightnesse who doth sit vpon the throne angells not able are to stand before alas how darst thou then there stand alone without the mediation of the holy one like birdlime merits so thy wings besmeare that thou not able art to take thy slight aboue the firmament or to come neere that euershining lamp of heaunly light which ought thy prayers to direct aright in knowledge meeknesse and humility by which we feele and haue and inward sight of our vnworthinesse and misery and seeke else where for worth and true felicity eun to that liuely fountaine of the lamb which is a deepe well wondrously profound from which by prayer breaking vp the dam we draw vp waters which doe there abound the depth of this rich well no grace can sound but feruent prayer when as shee doth desire to coole her thirst with waters therein found wherewith if once we coole our thirst like fire the more we drinke thereof the hotters our desire an oxes lowing barking of a dog grunting of swine doth more the lord delight than prayers which the world and flesh so clog they come not from vs with a heart and sprite and as no salue or medicine hath might to heale the wound which iron doth containe so prayer neuer profiteth that wight in whom hypocrisie or guile remaine for these still fester deeper to the patients paine god is our soules physitian and knows best what for her sicknesse is best remedy and therfore when we needfull things request of him for this our lifes necessitie he better then his patient can descry what is most fit to keepe him from the graue and cure him of his spirituall malady wherefore when we receiue not what we craue we know christ better knows than we what need we haue gods words the sword whereby our lord doth sway and rules his church here as he is a king as priest he offers praises and doth pray as prophet he glad tidings vs doth bring most wisely teaching and admonishing thus aaronlike to god he doth present our prayers praises tythes and offering for aarons office christs did represent and makes them giue to god an acceptable sent prayer is mans best fence the angells ioy the deuills torture gods sweet sacrifice we by her meanes all blessings here enioy by prayer we obtaine here to be wise by prayer with th almighty we aduise by reading he doth answere vs againe but our liplabour he doth all despise ah what doe then those simple people gaine which in a tongue vnknowne doe mutter praiers vaine oh when the spirit with vnderstanding prays and evn the heart with sighs and groanes vp sends to him that willing able is always vs from hell death and danger to defend then as a bullet doth the welkin rend blowne with the force of powder and of fire so doe our prayers vp to heaun ascend by zeale and force of spirituall desire where they of god obtaine all things they can require moses gainst amalec doth more preuaile by prayer and by holding vp his hands then mighty iosuah though he doth assaile them with his strong and most selected bands at iosuahs short sweet prayer the

priests and peoples hearts and voices ioyn to teare the skies with cryes and supplication oh force vnited of a congregation in gods owne house of prayer gathered for praise petition or for deprecation god nought denyeth so petitioned and wee thus from all euill are deliuered when peter slept with chaines in prison bound on each side souldiers keepers at the doore the church doth pray though hee

freedome of that dire calamity which came on him for our iniquitie and though he legions could of angells call to saue him from inhumane cruelty yet lamblike did before his shearer fall submitting to his fathers will and pleasure all without vs god will nothing for vs doe we therefore must prepare to fight alway and without god we can nor stand nor goe and therefore must be alwayes swift to pray if these so prayd when foes did them assay when flesh and bloud with flesh and bloud did fight what shall we in this dangerous great affray when we encounter with spirituall might which in his agony did christ our head affright but ah we at our first conuersion pray most feruently oft for the nouelty but after negligent cold sleeping say our paternoster in security thou sleepst secure but ah thine enemy doth watch thee thyn evn napping to surprise we then to god withall our hearts doe cry when as no thoughts withdraw vs otherwise alas but few or none pray often in this wise oh that a man

hym gouerned ruled thrugh hys noble cheualry soo that he conquered all the londes aboute hym so that almoost al the kynges of ye worlde to hym were attendaut it befell thus that this dyoclesya spowsed a gentyl damoysell that was woder fayre that was his vncles doughter labana she loued hym as reason wolde so that he gate vpo her xxxiii daughters of the whiche ye eldest was called a bine and these damoyselles wha they came vnto aege became so fayre that it was wonder wherof dyoclesyan anone lete make a somonynge comaunded by his letters that all ye kynges that helde of hym sholde come at a

there they lyued in ioye myrth ynough that it was wonder to wyte and it befell thus that dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge al tho kynges that were at that solempnyte and so they spake

the barons and lordes of sirrie couseyled not so for to do suche streytnesse to his owne doughters but only sholde voyde the londe of them for euer more so that they neuer sholde come ayen and so he dyde and dyoclesyan that was theyr fader anone comaunded them to go in to a shyppe deliuered to the vytaylles for half a yere and whan this was done all the systers went in to the shyppe and saylled forthe in the see betoke all theyr frendes to apolin that was theyr god and so long they saylled in the see tyll at the last they came and arryued in an yle that was all wyldernesse and whan dame

in albyon and they dwelled in caues and in hylles atte ther wylle and hadde the londe of albyon as them lykyd vnto ye tyme that brute arryued and came to tornes that was in the yle of albyon and there this brute coquered and dyscomfyted the gyauntes abouesayde explicit prima pars here begynneth now how brute was goten how he slewe first his moder after his fader and how he conquered albyon that after he named brytayne after his owne name that now is callyd englonde after ye name of engyst of saxonie this brute came in to brytayne aboute the xviii yere of hely be it knowen that in the noble cytee of grete troy there was a noble knyght a man of grete power that was called eneas and whan the cyte of troy was loste destroyed thrugh them of grece thys eneas wyth all his meyne fledde thes came to lombardy that the was lorde gouernoure of ye londe a kyng that was called latyne and an other kynge there was that was called turocelyne that strongely warred vpon this kynge latyne that oftentymes dyde hym moche harme and wha this kynge latyne herde that eneas was come he receyued hym with moche honour him with helde for as moche as he had herde of hym wyst wel that he was a noble knyght a worthy of hys body of his dedes this eneas helped kyng latyne i his warre and shortely for to telle so well and so worthely he dyde that he slewe turocelyne and discomfyted hym and all his people and whan all this was done kynge latyne gaaf all that londe that was turocelynes to thys noble man eneas in maryage wyth lauyne his doughter ye moost fayrest creatue that ony man wyst and so they lyued togyder in yoy  myrthe all the dayes of ther lyftyme and after ascanius sone to eneas wedded a wyf vpon her he gate a sone that was called silueyne and this silueyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwetynge his fader and aenst his wyll aqueyted hym with a damoysell that was cosyn to lauyne that was kynge latynes doughter ye quene that was eneas wyf and brought the damaysell with chylde and whan ascanius his fader it wyst anone lete enqueyre of ye wysest maysters of ye grettest clerkes what chylde the domoysell sholde brynge forth they answerde sayd that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shalde kylle bothe his fader also his moder and so he dyde for his moder deyed in berynge of hym and whan this childe was borne his fader lete calle hi brute and the maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme sorowe in many dyuers places and after he sholde come to grete honour and worshyp this kyng ascanius deyed whan god wolde and silueyne his sone receyued the londe made hym wonderly well beloued amonge his people and so wha brute that was silueynes sone was xv yere olde he wente vpon a day with his fader for to play solace and as brute sholde haue shot vnto an herte his arowe myshappe and gla ced and so there brute slewe hys fader how brute was dreuen out of the londe and how he helde hym in grece and whan this myschauce was befall all ye people of the londe made sorowe ynough were sore an angred and for enche son there of they droue brute out of the lode wolde not suffre hym among them and wha he sawe that he myght not there abyde he we from thens in to grece and there he founde vii thousande men that were of the lygnage and kynred of troy that were come of grete blood as the story telleth as of men and wymmen and chyldern the whyche were all hollde in thraldome and bondage of the kynge pandras of grece for the dethe of achilles that was betrayed and slayne at troy this brute was a wonder fayre man and a stronge and a huge of his age and of gladde

wonder preuy moche beloued with the kynge soo that longe tyme brute dwelled with the kynge so at the laste they of troy and brute spake togyders of kynred and of lygnage of acquayntaunce there playned them vnto brute of ther sorowe of ther bondage of many other shames that the kynge pandras had them done and vnto brute they sayde vpon a tyme ye be a lorde of our lygnage a strong man a myghty  ye be

that yle is be compassed all wyth the see and noo man maye come ther in but it be by shyppes and in that londe were wonte to dwelle gyauntes but now it is not soo but all wyldernes and that londe is

that they came and arryued in his londe wythout his lycence and his leue and anone ordened hym a gret power for to dryue out brute to destroye hym all his people but it was so that kyng goffar was dyscomfyted all his peple and hym self fledde in to frauce there for helpe socour and in that tyme regned in fraunce xii kynges an xi of them assembled a grete power for to helpe goffar for to fight ayest brute this goffar dwelled with the of frau ce halfe a yere more and in the meane tyme whan goffar was in frauce brute and his company destroyed all the londe of gascoyne and lete take all the tresour that kyng goffar had there lete brynge it all in to his shyppes and this brute founde in that londe a fayry place and couenable there brute made a fayre castel and a stronge whan that this was done kyng goffar came from fraunce and xi kynges with hym and brought wyth hym xxm men for to fyghte with brute and his company and brute had but viim ccc men and neuertheles whanne the two hostes

lete calle that same castell toures for by cause of the name of turin that there was entred and yet vnto this day there is a noble cyte that is called toures and kynge goffar wyste that turin was deed he came agayne with his men after yaue a stronge bataylle vnto brute but brute his men were so wery for fyghtynge that they myght noo lenger endure but to megre hym all his and then brute yede in to

of toures there where he had entered turin his cosyn how brute arryued at totnesse in the yle thenne called albyon and of the bataylle that was betwixt corin and gogmagog so whan all this was done brute wolde no lenger there dwell for to fyghte nor for to lese no moo of his people for kynge goffars people myghte euery daye encreace mo and moo and brutes lossened and therfore he toke all his men

done must be done whose name be blessyd wythout ende how kynge constantyne was vexed of mordred two sones this constantyne was a noble knyght and a worthy of body and tho two sones that mordred had begoten had grete enuy of constatyne that tho was crowned kynge and so it befell yt they meued warre ayenst hym and assembled a grete host of them that were before with mordred had ben dryuen a waye

they had ben borne of oo body the kynge edell had a suster that was called orewenne and he gaf her thrught grete freodshyp to kyng adelbryght to wyf and he begate vpon her a doughter that was called argentyll and in the thyrde yere after came vpon hym a strange sykenesse that nedes he must deye and he sente to kynge edell hys broder in lawe that he sholde come and speke wyth hym and he came to

by othe confermed hys prayer and whan adelbryght was deed and enteryd edell tooke the damoysell argentyll and nourrsshed her in hys chambre and she became as fayre as ony myghte be how kynge edell maryed that damoysell to a knaue of his kechyne this kyng edell that was vncle to argentyll be thought how that he myght falsely haue the londe fro his nyce for euer more and falsely aynst hys othe thought to dysceyue ye damoysell and to marye her to a knaue of his kechyne that was called curan and he became ye worthyest and strongest man of body that ony man wyst in ony londe that tho lyued and to hym he thought her shamfully haue maryed for to haue had her londe afterwarde but he was clene dysceyued for thys curan was hauelockis sone that was kynge of kyrkelane in denmarke and this curan conquered hys wyues londe after warde and slewe kyng edel that was h  wyues vncle and had al her londe as in an other place it telleth more openly he regned but iii yere for saxons danes hi slewe that was grete harme to all brytayn srytons bare hym to sto  henge and entyred hym honourably of kyng conan that was curans cosyn after this curan regned his cosyn conan that was a wonder proude knyghte and regned and coude haue noo maner of loue but euer he was medlynge wyth hys people and tooke his vncle with warre and slewe his two chyldern the saxons warred ayenst hym oftentymes but he them ouer

regned his cosyn cortyf that was behated of all his peple no thynge beloued this cortyf lost all brytayne thrugh warre and i his tyme fell ye grete myscheyf in brytayn ye crystendom was destroyed all ye brytons were dryue out of the londe and the londe lost with out ony recouer but after warde left the londe to the saxons as ye afterwarde shall here for in that tyme there was a paynem that was called gormo de that was the kynges sone daufrices of the panems folke that hadde the reame after hys fader was kynge sauf he bequaue yaue it to his broder and sayd that he wolde neuer be kynge but yf that he myght gete and conquere a reame in a straunge countree for he was bolde stronge of body and of hym prophecyed merlyn sayde that hesholde be a wulf of the see and he lette assemble paynems wythout nombre lete appareylle shyppes wente by many londes toke homages feautees of many and so he wente by the see conquered many dyuerse londes so that he came in to irlonde conquered that lond that often tymes warred vpon brytons and brytons vpon them oft wonne oft lost yaue hostages to brytons and so they sent to gurmonde there that he was in irlonde that he shold come in to brytayne and helpe them ayenst ye brytons to helpe them to delyuer that londe of them they wolde hym holde gladly for theyr lord for he was a paynem and they were paynems the brytons were crystened well ought he them for to helpe so as they were all of one lawe wha gurmonde herde this prayer he hasted him as moche as he myght arryued in scotlonde came in to northomberlonde there that the saxons were dwellynge and they confermed the couenautes bytwene them that were made by othes by hostages for to bere hym true fay holde hym for lorde and paye to hym truage by the yere tho began the saxons and ye affricans to destroye robbe and brenne townes destroye all theng  in asmoche as they myght spared neyther man woman ne chylde lerned ne lewde but all they slewe caste downe townes castels chirches so put they all the londe in grete destruccyon and as soone as they myghte flee they fledde thens as well poore as ryche bysshops abbottes chanons all other grete smal some in to lytell brytayne some in to cornewayle all tho ye shyppes myghht haue how the kynge gurmonde droue kyng cortyf to chechestre slewe the brytons thrugh crafte engyne gate the same towne cortyf the kyng fledde thens in to chechestre that tho was stronge and there helde hym xx dayes this gurmonde came and it besyeged but the cytee was so stronge that he myght not gete it by no maner of wyse with engyne that they myght doo tho bethought they vpon a subtylte for to brenne the towne they made engynes wyth glewe of nettes toke pecys of thunder of fyre bonde it to sparowes feet than lete them flee and they anoe flewe lodged the in ye towne ther yt theyr nestis were in stackes euesynges of houses ye fyre began to kyndle brente all ye towne and whan the brytons sawe that in euery syde they hyed them out fought but anone they were slayne and dyscomfyted and whyle batayll dured the kynge pryuely hydde hym and stale awaye in to walys men wyst neuer where he became and soo was the towne of chechestre taken and destroyed and after gurmonde wente and destroyed townes and cytees that neuer were after made ayen as it is seen yet in many places of thys londe how thys londe was called englonde for the name of engyst how many kynges were made after in thys londe so whan gurmonde had destroyed al the londe thrugh out he yaue the londe to the saxons anone they toke it with good wyll for the saxons longe tyme had desyred it for asmoche as they wereof engist kynred that fyrst had all the londe of brytayne lete them be called englyssmen for by cause of engistes name the lond they lete call englonde in theyr langage the folke ben called englyshmen for asmoche as in thys tyme it was called engist londe whan he had coquered it of vortiger that spoused hys doughter but fro the tyme yt brute came fyrst in to englonde thys londe was called brytane and the folke brytons but syth the tyme yt thys gurmonde conquered it eftsones and yaue it vnto the saxons they anone ryght chauged the name as before is sayde and whan thys was done gurmonde passed ouer in to frau ce there conquered many londes destroyed all cristen peple there that he came and the saxons dwelled in this londe and began fast to enhabyte it at ther owne wyll and they wolde haue made newe kyngis lordes but they myght neuer assent to haue only oo kynge for to be to them attendaunt therfore they made many kynges in dyuerse shyres as it was in engistes tyme the fyrste kyngdome was kente that othe southsexe and the thyrde westsex the fourth eestsex the fyfth nothu berlonde and ye sixth estangle that is to saye northfolke and southfolke and the seuenth mercheryche and that is the erldoste of nycholl hutyngdon herforde gloucetre wynlchestre wer wyke derby and so departed all englond in to vii partyes and after that it befell that tho kyng warred oft tymes togyder and euer he that was strongest toke hym that was feblest and soo it was longe tyme yt they had noo kynge crowned amonge theym ne no crysten man was tho amonge them ne crystendome nather but were paynems tyll that saynt gregory was pope of rome that had seen childern of the nacyon of englonde in the cyte of rome that were wonder fayre creatures had grete wyll and desyre theym to beholde and axed of ye marchautes whens they were and of what nacyon and men tolde hym that they were of englonde and inglysshe they were called but they all the people of englonde were paynems and byleued not vpon god alas sayde saynt gregory well maye they be called englysshe for they haue the vysages of angels and therfore well ought they to be crystened and for this cause saynt gregory theresente saynt austyn in to englode xl good me with hym that were of good lyf holy men to preche teche to comuetre the englysshe people them to torne to god that was in the vi yere that saynt gregory had be pope of rome that is to saye ofter thyn carnacyon of our lorde ihesu cryste vclxxxv yeres as the cronycle telleth how saynt austyn baptysed and conuerted kynge adelbryght and the bysshoppes that he made his felowes as saynt austyn came fyrste in to englonde he arryuen in the yle of tenet and so passed forth came vnto caunterbury and there soyourned and kynge adelbryght of kent that was the lygnage of engist goodly receyued saynt austyn hys felowes wyth moche honour and them foude all that them neded and more ouer he yaue theym a fayre place that now is called the abbay of shynt austyn in whiche place he lyth hym self shryned this kynge adelbryght was a good man wyth good wylle herde saynt austyns predycacyons and yaue hym leue to preche thrughout all hys londe before sayd of kente to torne and conuerte to hym all ye people that he myght it befelle soo after thorugh goddes grace that in lytell tyme the kynge hymself was conuerted to god and all hys peop of his londe were baptysed and in the meane whyle the peple torned them to god saynt austyn came to rochestre there he preched the worde of god and the paynems therfore hym scorned and caste vpon hym reygh taylles so that all his mantell was hanged full of these reygh tayles and for more dyspyte they caste vpon hym the guttes of reyghes other fysshe wherfore the good man saynt austyn was sore anoyed and greued and prayed to god that all tho chyldern of that cyte that sholde be borne after warde that is for to saye in the of rochestre myght haue taylles and soo they hadde and whan the kynger herde of this vengeaunce that was falle thrugh saynt austyns prayer he lete make an house in the honour of almyghty god wherin wymmen sholde be delyuered of theyr childern at the bryges ende in the whiche hous yet wymmen of the cyte ben delyuerde of chylde whan that saynt gregory hadde hrede tell how the englysshe people were torned to god comuerted he sente vnto saynt austyn his pallyon by a b  sshop that was called paulin and made hym prymate archebysshop of englonde and sente worde that he sholde ordeyne make dysposynge the londe and anone austyn had the pallyon of the dygnyte of the archebysshyp he made two bysshops of his felowes that came with hym fro rome one was called mellite he dwelled at london that other was called iustin that helde the dygnyte at rochestre and this bysshop mellite tho went to preche in to estsex and erystened the kynge of the countree that was called sicwith that was kynge adlebrytes cosyn hys systers sone thys iustyn wente to preche in southse  and torned moche of the people to god and saynt austyn hymselfe preched thorugh out englonde how saynt austyn wente in to waels there the brytons were how they wolde not beobedyent tothe archebysshop of cauterbury so whan all englonde was crystened and torned to god saynt astuyn went in to that londe there that the brytons were for to kepe them frome englysshmen that is to saye in to ways and there he founde monkes abbayes and vii bysshops for ye brytons alwaye destroyed the crysten people that saynt austyn had conuerted and he sayde to the bysshops that he was a legate of rome prymate of all englonde that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyenc they sayde they nolde but to the archebysshop of carlyon they wolde they wolde neuer for noo maner thynge be obedyent to the englysshe men for the englysshemen they sayde ben our aduersaryes our enmyes haue dryuen vs out of our countree weben crysten men euer haue be and the englysshemen haue euer be paynems but now of late that they ben conuerted saynt austyn of them myght haue none answere otherwyse but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer them meke to hym ne to the pope of rome and saynt austyn torned ayen tho to kynge adelbryght yt was kynge of kent and tolde hym that hys folke wolde not be to no man obedyent but to the archebysshop of carlyon and whan the kynge herde thys he was sore anoyed sayd that he wolde them destroye and sent to elfryde kynge of northunberlonde that was hys frende that he sholde come to hym with al the power that he myght and that he wolde mete hym at leycetre and fro thens they wolde go in to walys and there destroye the archebysshop of carlyon and all tho that had refused saynt austyn how kynge adelbryght and the kynge elfryde slewe brecinall that was a kynge of brytons that helde the countree of leycetre it be tell soo that there was a kynge of brytons that helde the countree of leycetre and alle the countree aboute hys name was brecinall and this bryton herde telle that tho two englysshe kynges wolde mete there at leycetre for to goo in to walys he lete ordeyne all the power that he had for to goo fyght with these two kynges but lytel it auayled hym for his folke that he had were slayne and hymself fledde loste his londes for euer more and these two kynges adelbryght elfryde dwelled a whyle at leycetre and departed the londe amonge them and tooke homag and feautees of the

wyked yt they wold neuer speke to the but them slewe euerychone alas for sorowe for they ne spared them noomore than the wulfe dothe the shepe but smot of theyr heedes euerychone so they were all martrd that to them came that is to vnderstande vc xl after they wente fro thens to bangor for to slee all those that ther myghte there fynde of the brytons and whan ye brytouns herde that they assembled and ordened all ther power for to fyght with thyem two was there a baron in walys that was called bledrik of cornewayle that some tyme was lorde of deuenshyre but the kynge adelbright had dreuen hym out in to walys and after there he yaue them batayll and at that batayll was kynge adelbright slayne and efrydesore wouded forsoke the felde the moost partye of his people slayne and elfryde flede in to northumberlonde that was his owne lo de and after that the people of leycetre shyre made with strenght cadewan yt was brycinals sone kynge of leceytre and he afterregned nobly and with grete honour how cade wan kynge of leycetre elfryde kynge of northumberlonde were frendes of the debate yt after was bytwene edwyn cad walyn that were both theyr sones and after that thys bataylle was done yt brytons assembled them and wente thens and came to leycetre and made there caudewan that was brecinals sone kynge of leycetre and of all the countree aed he toke homages feautes of all the folke of the countree and after that he assembled a grete hoste and sayde he wolde goo in to northumberlonde to destroy kynge elfryde and sle hym yf he myght and whan he was come thether frendes wente so bytwene them that they accorde them in this manere that elfryde sholde holde all the londe fro northumberlonde to scotlonde and cadewan sholde haue all the londe a thys syde humbre to

as his fader hadde holde all his lyf tyme and cadewa had another sone called cadwalyn that helde his faders londe as he it helde whyle he was alyue and these loued as bretheren and ye loue lasted betwyxt them but only two yere after began debat betwyxt them throughe a synple enuyous cosyn of cadwalins called bryens so yt they assembled a grete hoste in bothe partyes and at the laste it be fell ye cadwalin was dyscuforted edwen hym pursued droue hym fro place to place so at the last he fledde in to irelonde and ye other destroyd pylled his londe and cast downe castels brente his maners departed all cadwalins londe amonge his frendes and longe tyme after came cadwalen ayen fro irlonde with a stronge pour and in playne batayll slewe edwyn all his frendes namely tho yt with helde his

the londe of northumbrelonde by herytage yt was called oswalde he was kynge of all the londe but for as moche as he was frende to edwyn and helde a grete parte of the londe of cadwalin this same cadwalyn warred vpon hym droue hym to warde scotlond and whan cadwalin sawe that he wolde not abyde cadwalin wolde no lenger hym pursue but toke some of his folke to peanda his broder in lawe prayed hym to pursue after oswalde tyl that he were take slayne and cadwalin toruned home ayen whan oswalde herde these tydynges that cadwalin tourned home ayen he wolde no le ger flee but abode peanda yaue

a grete hoste for to fyght with oswalde soo that he and peanda came to northumberlonde yaue batayll vnto oswalde and in the same batayll was oswalde slayne his heed smyten of after he was entered at the abbay of berdenay in whiche place god hadde wrought for hym many a fayre myracle bothe there and elles where and anone oswy his brother seased all the londe in to his honde that was this oswaldis and the folke of northumberlonde loued him wonderly well and helde hym for theyr lorde but he had men of his kynne worthy ynough that wolde haue departed the londe and they warred togyed well and for asmoche as they were not stronge ynoughe they came to peanda and prayed hym of helpe socour and behyght hym of ye lode largely vpo this couenat that he wold them gouerne helpe counseyl peanda herde theyr prayer so spake with cadwalyn that he sholde ordayne a grete host and faste ordeyned hym in to northumberlonde for teyght with oswy and oswy was a meke man moche loued peas charyte and prayed peanda of loue peas and profe  ede hym of golde and syluer grete plentye and this peanda was so proude yt he nolde graunt hym peas fo no maner thynge but for all thynge he wolde with hym fyght s  o at the laste there was sette a daye of batayll and oswy euer trusted vpon god and peanda trusted tomoche vpon pryde and vpon his hoste that he had and to gyder they smote egerly but peanda was anone dyscomforted and slayne and this was after the incarnacyon of oure lorde ihesu cryste vclv yere and this oswy regned xxviii yere and a kynge that was called oswyne that was peandaes cosyn warred vpon

the laste kynge of brytons after the deth of cadwelin regned hys sone cudwaldre well and nobly and his moder was ye syster of peanda and whan he had regned xii yere he felle in to a grete sykenesse thenne was there a greate dyscorde bytwene the lordes of the londe that euery of them warred vpon other and yet in that tyme there fell so grete derth scarsyte of corn other viteylles in this londe that a man myghte go iii or iiii dayes fro towne to towne yt he sholde not fynde to bye for golde ne syluer brede wyne ne none other vitayle where wich a man myght lyue but onely the people lyued by

amonge the people by the corrupcyon of the ayre that ye lyuynge people suffysed not to burye the deed bodyes for they deyed soo sodenly bothe grete and smalle lorde seruaunt in etynge goynge spekynge they fell downe and deyed so that neuer was herde of more sodeyne deth amonge the people for he that wente for to burye the deed body with the same deed body was buryed and soo they that myght flee

dured xi yere and more that noman myght ere ne sowe how cadwaldre wente out of this londe in to lytell brytayne cadwaldre sawe grete hungre mortalyte pestylence and the londe all poore faylynge cornes ad other vytaylles and his folke perysshed sawe also the mooste partye of his londe all wasted voyde of people he apparelled hym and his folke that were lefte alyue and passede ouer in to lytell

dyde alle tho that were with hym and sayde dedisti nos domine tanquan  oues escaru et in gentibus dispersisti nos and thenne began cadwaldre to complayne hym to his folke pyteously and sayd alas sayd

natures sh  of men came in to ye londe of albion lay by those women shad tho natures vpon them they conceyued brought forth gyautes of whiche one was called gogmagog another langerigan and so they were named by dyuers names in this maner they came forth were borne horryble gyautes in albion and they dwelled in caues in hylles at theyr wyll had the londe of albion as them lyked vnto ye tyme that brute arryued came to totnes yt was in the yle of albion there this brute coquered discofyted ye gyautes aboue sayd  explicit prima pars  here begyneth now how brute was goten how he slewe fyrst his moder after his fader and how he conquered albyon that after he named brytayne after his owne name that now is called englonde after the name of engyst of saxonye this brute came in to brytayne aboute the xviij yere of hely be it knowen that in ye noble cite of grete troy there was a noble knyght and a man of grete power that was called eneas and whan ye cite of troy was lost destroyed through them of grece this eneas with all his meyny fledde thens came in to lombardy and tho was lorde gouernour of that londe a kyng that hyght latyne and another kynge there was ye hyght turocelyne that strongly warred vpon this kynge latyne ye oftentymes dyd hym moche harme and whan this kynge latyne herde yt eneas was come he receyued hym with moche honour hym with helde for as moche as he had herd of hy and wyst well yt he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body of his dedes this eneas helped kynge latyne in his wa  shortly for to tell so well so worthely he dyd that he slewe turocelyne dyscomfyted hym all his people and whan all this was done kyng latyne gaue all ye londe that was turocelynes to this noble man eneas i  maryage with lauyne his doughter the moost fayrest creature that ony man wyst and so they lyued togyder in ioye and myrth all the dayes of theyr lyues  and after ascanius sone to eneas wedded a wyfe and vpon her he gate a sone that was called siluine and this siluyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwytyng his fader and agaynst his wyll acqueynted hym wt a damoysel that was cosyn to lauyne that was kynge latynes doughter ye quene that was eneas wyfe and brought the damoysell with chylde and whan ascanius his fader it wyst anone let enquyre of the wysest maysters and of the gretest clerkes what chylde the damoysell sholde brynge forth and they answered and sayd that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shold kyll bothe his fader and his moder and so he dyd for his moder dyed in berynge of hym and whan this chylde was borne his fader let call hym brute and ye maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme and sorowe in many dyuerse places and after he sholde come to grete honour and worshyp this kyng ascanius dyed whan god wolde and siluyne his sone receyued the londe and made hym wonder  ly well beloued among his people and so wha brute that was siluynes sone was xv yere olde he went vpon a daye with his fader for to playe solace and as brute shold haue shotte vnto an hart his arowe myshapped glanced and so there brute slewe his fader  how brute was dryuen out of the londe how he helde hym in grece and whan this mischauce was befallen all ye people of the londe made grete sorowe and were sore dyspleased and bycause therof they droue brute out of ye londe wolde not suffre hym amonge them and whan he sawe that he might not abyde there he went from thens in to grece there he foude vij thousande men that were of ye kynrede of troye and were comen of grete blode as the story telleth as of men and women children the whiche were all holden in thraldome bondage of kyng pandras of grece for ye deth of achylles that was betrayed slayne at troy this brute was a woders fayre man and a stronge huge of his age and of gladde chere semblaut also worthy of body was well beloued amoge his people this kyng pandras herde speke of his goodnes condicyons anone made hym to dwell with hym so that brute became wonders preuy moche beloued with ye kynge dwelled longe tyme with the kynge so at ye last they of troy brute spake togyder of kynrede lygnage of acqueyntauce and there complayned them vnto brute of theyr sorowe of theyr bondage and of many other shames ye kynge pandras had done to them to brute they sayd vpon a tyme ye be a lord of our lignage a stronge man a myghty be ye our capytayne gouernour we wyll become your

to woodes in to moutaynes helde them there and sente vnto kynge pandras that he sholde gyue them lycence for to departe safely out of his lode and kyngdom for they wolde no longer dwell in his bondage whan kyng pandras herde this he was sore vexed and anoyed tho sware that he wolde  e them euerychone and ordeyned a grete power and went towardes them for to fyght with them but brute and his men manly them defended and fyersly fought slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped and toke ye kynge and put hym in pryson and ordeyned a couseyle amonge them selfe what they myght do wt the kynge and some sayd that he sholde be put to deth and some sayd that he sholde be exyled out of the londe some sayd yt he sholde be brent and than spake a wyse knyght yt was called mempris sayd to

all his folke consented gladly to ye couseyle and this thyge they tolde to kyng pandras and he for to haue his lyfe grauted as moche as they demaunded and anone gaue vnto brute the fayre lady gennogen his doughter to wyfe and an hondred shyppes with as moche as them  of all vytayles as afore was ordeyned tha brute toke his wyfe all his men that forsoke the londe of grete went to the see had wynde weder at theyr wyll came the thyrde daye in to an yle that was called logres this brute anone sent of his men to londe for to espye ye maner of ye coutrce and they founde an olde cite all wasted forlet so that there was neyther man nor woma therin dwellynge and in the myddle of this cyte they foude an olde temple of a fayre lady that was called diane the goddesse and they came agayne vnto

called albion that yle is becompassed all with the see no man may come therin but it be by shyppes in that londe were wont to dwell gyauntes but now it is not so but all wyldernes that londe is destenyed ordeyned for you for your people  how coryn became brutes man how kynge goffar was discomfyted and whan brute had this answere of diane the goddesse anone he let wyde vp the ancres sayled in

they were he toke them wt moche ioye in to his shyppes so he ladde them forth with hym this coryn there became brutes man to hy dyd homage and so loge they sayled forth in the see tyll they came in to gascoyne anone they arryued in ye hauen of lyegers there they dwelled viij dayes for to rest them and to amende theyr sayles there as they had nede ty dynges soone came to kyng goffar that was lord of

his leue and anone ordeyned hym a grete power for to dryue out brute to destroye hym all his people but it was so ye kynge goffar was dyscomfyted all his people hymselfe fledde in to fraunce for to

brute let bury hym worthely whan he had space in ye castell yt he had made tho let call yt same castell tours for bycause of the name of turin yt there was buryed and yet vnto this daye there is a

corin wt the busshemet he his company smote to the groude all those y wolde stande or abyde so ye kynge goffar his company were discomfyted fast they began to flec and brute coryn with theyr company fyersly them pursued and slewe moo of them in the fleynge than they dyd in y batayle and in this maner brute had y victory neuertheles brute made moche sorow for his cosyn turyn that there was slayne other also that he had lost of his men that is to saye vij hondred and xv the whiche nobly he buryed in the same castell of tours there where that he had buryed turyn his cosyn  how brute arryued at

people myght euery day encrease moo and moo brutes men lessed therfore he toke all his men wente vnto the see had wynde weder at theyr wyll and the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at cornes came in to this realme yt than was called albyon where they founde neyther man nor woman saue grete gyauntes they dwelled in mountaynes in cauernes and brute sawe the londe was fayre and at his ly

for to wrastle so togyder they went wrastled a loge tyme but at the last gogmagog helde coryn so fast yt he brake two rybbes in his syde wherfore coryn was sore angry there he toke gogmagog bytwene his armes cast hym downe vpon a roche soo that gogmagog brake all to peces so he dyed an euyll deth therfore the place is called yet vnto this day the saute of gogmagog and tha after brute gaue all that coutree vnto corin and than corin called it after his name cornewayle his men ben called cornewayles so sholde men of that countree be called for euermore and in that countree dwelled corin his

whiche now is called temmes and there brute began to buylde a fayre cyte and called it newe troye in remembraunce of grete troye from the whiche place all theyr lygnage was comen and this brute let fell downe wodes let ere sowe londes let mawe down medowes for ye sustenauce of hy his people and tha he departed ye londe to them so yt eche of them had a parte place to dwell in and tha brute let

sped them fast towarde theyr enemyes for to gyue them batayle and lotryn had sente to cambar his broder yt he sholde come vnto hym with all ye power that he myght make for to helpe hym to auenge his broders deth and so he dyd with a good wyll whan they came togider they toke theyr waye pryuely for to go seke kynge humbar where they myght fynde hym and so it befell that this kynge humbar was

all the north coutree throughout tyll y they came to the parke of stanhope in wyre dale there y scottes helde them in a busshmet but whan y kyng had herde through certayn spyes where y scottes were

that was kyng edwardes vncle that y foresaid thomas sholde not assemble at that tyme vnto y scottes he assented but he wyst not the doynge bytwene the scottes the foresayd mortimer and bycause y he was marshall of englode to hym perteyned euer y vautwarde he sent hastely to y erle of lancastre to syr iohn of henaud that they shold not fyght with the scottes in preiudyce harmyng of hym his fee yf

kepe of the hoost y nyght dystroubled y watche that nothynge myght be done and in y meane whyle y scottes stole by nyght toward theyr owne countree as fast as they myght and so was the kynge falsly betrayed that wende y all the traytours of his londe had ben brought to an ende as it was said before now here ye lordes how traytoursly y kyng edward was deceyued and how meruaylously boldly the scottes dyd of warre for iames douglas wt two hondred men of armes rode throughout all the hoost of kyng edward the same nyght y scottes escaped toward theyr owne coutre as is aboue sayd tyll y they came to y kynges pauylyon and slewe there many men i theyr beddes cryed naward naward an other tyme a douglas a douglas wherfore y kyng that was in his pauilyon moche other folk were wonders sore afrayde but blissed be god y kyng was not taken in grete peryll was than y realme of englonde and y nyght the mone shone full clere bryght and for all the kynges men the scottes escaped harmeles and on the morowe whan the kyng wyst that the scottes were escaped in to theyr owne coutre he was woders sory full hertely wepte wt his yonge eyen yet wyst he not who had done hym y treason but that fals treason was full well knowen a good whyle after as the story telleth than kynge edwarde came agayne to yorke full sorowfull his hoost departed and euery man went in to his owne coutree with full heuy chere and mournynge semblaunt the henaudes toke theyr leue went in to theyr owne countre the king for theyr trauayle hugely rewarded them and for bycause of that vyage the kynge had dyspended moche of his tresour wasted  and in that tyme were seen two mones in y fyrmament that one was clere and that other was derke as men myght se through y worlde and a grete debate was y same tyme agaynst pope

hyght nicholas y was a frere minour that was agaynst the ryght of holy chirche wherfore he was cursed the power of that other pope soone was layd and bycause y suche meruayles were seen men sayd y the worlde was nygh at an ende  of the deth of kynge edwarde of carnaruan and now go we agayn to syr edward of carnaruan y was king edwardes fader somtyme kyng of englonde was put downe of his dignite alas for his tribulacion sorowe y hym befell through fals couseyle y he loued trusted vpon to moche that afterwarde were destroyed through theyr falsnesse as god wold and this edward of carnaruan was in y castell of berkeley vnder y kepyng of syr moryce of berkeley and syr iohn of mautreuers to them he made his coplaynt of his sorowe of his disease and ofte tymes asked of his wardeyns what he hadde trespaced agaynst dame isabell his wyfe syr edward his sone y was made newe kyng that they wold not visyte hym and tha answered one of his wardeyns sayd my worthy lorde dysplease you not y i

passed it was not longe after y the kyng through couseyle of roger mortymer grauted y warde kepynge of syr edward his fader to syr thomas toiourney to y foresayd syr iohn mautreuers through the kinges lettre put out holly y foresayd syr moryce of the warde of the kyng and they toke lad the kyng to y castell of corf y whiche castel y kyng hated as ony deth and they kept hym there tyll it came vn to saynt mathewes day in september in the yere of grace m ccc xxvii that the foresayd syr roger mortimer sent y maner of y deth how in what wyse he shold be put to deth and anone as y foresayd thomas iohn had seen y  comaudement they made kynge edwarde of carnaruan good chere good solace as they might at y souper and no thynge the kyng wyst of y treason and whan tyme was for to go to bedde the kynge wente vnto his bedde laye and slepte fast and as the kyng laye slepte the traytoures false for sworne agaynst theyr homage feaute came pryuely in to y kynges chambre theyr company with them layde an huge table vpon his wombe with men pressed helde fast down the foure corners of y table on his body wherwith y good man awoke and was wonders sore adrad to be deed there slayne turned his

therwith thyrled his bowelles so they slewe theyr lord that nothynge was perceyued was buryed at glocestre  how kynge edward spoused philip the erles doughter of henaud at yorke and after chrystmasse

bisshop of ely and syr william of melton archebysshop of yorke sange the masse ye sonday on ye euen of the couersion of saint paule in ye yere of grace m ccc xxvij but bycause that the kynge was yonge

grete harme was done to ye realme to ye kyng all men directed it to ye kynges dede it was not so almyghty god it knoweth wherfore it was ordeyned at ye kynges crownyng yt the kyng for his tender age sholde be gouerned by xij of the gretest lordes of englonde without whome no thynge shold be done that is to saye the archebysshop of cauterbury the archebisshop of yorke the bisshop of wynchestre the

were sworne truly for to couseyle ye kyng they shold answere euery yere in ye parlyamet of yt that sholde be done in the tyme of theyr gouernall but ye ordynauce was soone vndone that was moche harme to all englode for the kyng all the lordes ye shold gouerne hym were gouerned and ruled after the kyges moder dame isabell by syr roger mortimer and as they wolde all thynge was done bothe amonge hye lowe and they toke vnto them castels townes londes rentes in grete harme losse to the crowne of the kynges estate out of mesure  how the peas was made bytwene ye englisshmen the scottes and also of

the kyng through theyr couseyle none other of the londe within age graunted to be accorded with the scottes in this maner that all the feautees and homages that the scottes sholde do vnto the crowne of englonde forgaue them for euer more by his chartre ensealed and forthermore an endenture was made of the scottes vnto kynge edwarde that was kyng henryes sone whiche endenture they called ragman in the whiche were coteyned al ye homages feautees fyrst of the kynge of scotlonde of all the prelates erles barons of ye realme of scotlonde wt theyr seales set theron and other chartres remembraunces yt kynge edwarde and his barons had of theyr right in ye foresayd realme of scotlond it was forgyuen them agaynst holy chirche and also with ye blacke crosse of scotlonde the whiche ye good kynge edwarde conquered in scotlonde and brought it out of the abbey of scone yt is a full precyous relyke and also forthermore he relesed forgaue all the londes that the barons of englonde had in scotlonde by olde conquest  and this peas for to be hold and last the scottes were bounde vnto the kyng in xxx m poude of syluer to be payed within thre yere that is euery yere x m poude by euen porcyons and forthermore aboue all this they spake bytwene the partyes aboue sayd that dauyd dritonautier that was kynge robert the brus sone ye fals tyraunt fals forsworne agaynst his othe yt arose agaynst his

was kynge edwardes syster as ye gest telleth vpon mary magdaleyns daye in ye yere of grace m ccc and xxviij to grete harme empayrynge of all the kynges blode wherof that gentyll lady came alas ye tyme for wonders moche was that fayre damoysell desparaged syth that she was maryed agaynst all the comyns assent of englonde and fro the tyme that brute had conquered albion named the londe after his owne name brytayn that now is called englonde after the name of engyst and so the realme of scotlonde was holden of the realme of englonde of the crowne by feaute homage for brute conquered that londe and gaue it to albanack that was his seconde sone and he called that londe albayn after his own name so that the heyres that came after hym sholde holde of brute and of his heyres that is to saye of ye kynges of brytayne by feaute homage and fro that tyme vnto this tyme of kynge edwarde the realme of scotlonde was holden of the realme of englonde by feaute seruyce as aboue is sayd in ye cronycles of englonde of scotlonde and bereth wytnes more plenarly  and cursed be the tyme that this parliament was holden at northamton for there through fals couseyle the kyng was there falsly dysheryted yet he was within age and yet whan that kyng edward was put out of his royalte of englonde yet men put not hym out of ye feautees seruyce of scotlonde ne of the frauchyses dysheryted hym for euermore and neuertheles the grete lordes of englode were agaynst to confyrme ye peas the trewse aboue sayd saue onely quene isabell yt was the kynges moder edwarde and the bysshop of ely and the lorde montmer but reason lawe wolde not yt a fynall peas sholde be made bytwene them without the comyn assent of englonde  of the debate yt was bytwene quene isabell syr henry erle of lacastre of leycestre of the

for the cowardly peas that was ordeyned but the kynges persone bare al the wyte blame with wronge of the makynge of the accorde and all was done through the quene roger m  rtymer and it was not longe after that ye quene isabell ne toke in to her handes all the lordshyp of pountfret almoost all ye londes that were of ony value that apperteyned to the crowne of englonde so yt the kynge had not for

at good chepe wherfore the coutre yt they came in were full sore adrad and almoost destroyed of them tha began ye cominalte of englonde for to haue enuy to isabell the quene that so moche loued her before whan she came agayne fro frauce for to pursue the fals traytours ye spensers and in that same tyme ye false traytour robert of holand that be  rayed his lord syr thomas of lancastre was than delyuered out of pryson was wonders preuy with ye quene isabell also with roger mortimer but that auayled hy but lytell for he was taken at myghelmasse next folowyng as he rode toward the quene isabell to london syr thomas wyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt albons and this syr thomas dwelled with syr henry erle of lancastre he put hym asyde for drede of the quene for she loued hym wonders moche prayed vnto ye kyng for hym yt the same thomas myght be exiled out of englonde and ye noble erle syr henry of lancastre had oftentymes herde the comyn damour of ye englysshmen of yt disease that was done in englonde also for dyuers wronges yt were done to ye comyn people of the whiche the kyng bare the blame wt wronge for he was yonge tender of age and thought as a good man for to do awaye and slake the sclaundre of ye kynges person yf that he myght in ony maner wyse so as ye kyng was therof nothynge gylty wherfore he was in peryll of his lyfe and so he assembled all his

theyr othe for to maynteyn hym in that same quarell and theyr cause was this that the kyng sholde holde his hous and his meyny as a king ought to do haue all his ryalte that ye quene isabell shold deliuer out of her handes in to ye kynges handes all maner lordshyppes rentes townes castels yt apperteyned vnto ye crowne of englode as other quenes dyd before her and meddle with none other thynge and also that syr roger mortimer shold abyde dwell vpon his owne londes for ye whiche londes he had holpen to disheryte moche people in so moche that ye comyn people were destroyed through wrongfull takynge and also to enquyre how by whome the kynge was betrayed falsly deceiued at stan hope and through whose couseyle that the scottes went away by nyght from the kynge and also how and through whose couseyle ye ordynaunce that was made at the kynges crownacyon was put downe that is for to saye that the kynge for amendement and helpyng of the realme and in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and ruled by xij of the gretest and wisest lordes of the realme and without them sholde nothynge be grau ted ne done as before is sayd the whiche couenauntes were malycyously put downe from the kynge wherfore many harmes shames reproues haue fallen to the kyng and his realme and that is to vnderstand for as moche as edward somtyme kyng of englonde was ordeyned by assent of the comynalte in playne parlyament for to be vnder the warde gouernaunce of henry erle of lancastre his cosyn for saluacyon of his body he was taken out of ye castel of ken  worth where he was in warde through colour of

moche lordshyp retynue he had that all the grete lordes of englonde of hym were adrad wherfore the kynge his couseyle towardes hym were agreued ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reason and

so that no man myght come in nor out by nyght but through comaudement of mortimer ne ye kynge nor none of his couseyle and that tyme it befell so that mortimer as a deuyll for wrath boyled also for

between england and spain the essentiall poynts thereof seem to be the advantages and disadvantages of such an alliance and whether both weighed in equall ballance the one will not oversway the other the advantages that england may pretend are these first a great kings daughter secondly much mony thirdly safety fourthly continuance of trade fiftly the bridling of the overgrowing greatnes of the states sixtly the subiects of spain will not be se burthensome to england being more remote as those of france would be that are nearer neighbours lastly hindring the scottish faction for strengthning it selfe by the alliance of france which though it be not publickly taken knowledge of yet hath his place among the reasons that further the match with spaine these and the like benefits and

vaine the answer the meanest of the houshould of faith are much greater then those that are without for they are borne to a great inheritance these are their promises first god is their god and with them hath he made a covenant nor ought it to be forgotten that the house of spayn is stained with incest in the match with the last king his owne sisters daughter which cannot be but very loathsome to every true christians hart and yet to speake according to the world the estate of england is great enough of it selfe match it where it will as it hath done in times past and as other great monarkes haue led the way and the alliance of france is neere and hath no ill aspect upon england and is as honourable as that of spain that of france will not proue so beneficiall and so neither so dangerous or prejudiciall secodly mony wil be soon wasted and melted away but the price of it will abide still and let not any flater themselues spayn giveth nothing but for something and where he giveth much he looketh for a great returne examine well their actions and proceedings and make use of experience whether can or ought mony to be an essentiall consideration to sway the weight of so important an alliance thirdly is not england stronger at this time and spain weaker then heretofore where then is any cause of feare but alow that the state of england stood in feare of any danger of spayn will this alliance secure them the feare is idle and the remedy more idle unlesse any could make it good that the love of spayne unto england the match going forward would proue the predominant humor in him that should sway his ambission whereof the world hath so much experience to the contrary charles the fift gaue his owne sister in mariage to francis the first was francis ever a whit the safer for such an alliance savoy hath married spaines sister who nevertheles doth what he can to swalow him up france and spaine haue lastly made a double match ler it be examined whether spaine hath laboured more to quench or kindle the fier in france and yet they are both of one and the same religion they erre who thinke there is any thinge to be had from a papist for love rather then for feare or that spaine will ever dessist from aspiring to the universal monarchy of christondome and particularly the recovery of the uuited provinces for though he often strike saile and put into the harbour in fowle weather yet doth he not neglect to weigh anchour againe and follow his intended course when the season is fit for it england doth hinder his designes and therefore would he match with england to haue the fitter passage for him and if he were in quiet posession of all the seventeene provinces then would they be made a stable or storehouse for all things necessary in so plentifull and well fitted a situation for the invading the parts neare adioyning whereof the plots are not new if england give way unto him then disapointed of their defences and bulwarkes they will stand as it were at his mercy and ly open to all manner of batteries as on the other side if he be crossed then will things be but where they vvere both for continuance and assurance against fear of invasion nay rather in so much the worse termes because he shall faile of his expectation which commonly breeds much harshnes even amongst the dearest freinds let not any cast a mist in others eyes though spain had left aside his wonted ambition which none can sufficiently assure yet will he never loose his hope or relent in his resolution of recovering the united provinces wherein his honour and his reputation are so deeply interessed nor can such a great scattered body that hath so many irons in the fier be but continually armed and still in action to the danger both of freinds and foes as he shall finde his best advantages and oportunities if england fear spain their safety will rather stand in keeping him at the staves end then in receaving such an ambitious and new reconciled enemy and doubtfull frend into their bosom where he shall vvithout blovves be able to doe them much more hurt by his daily practice and corrupting of the subiects then he can otherwise by open hostility which he will be wary enough not to attempt lest they ioyning their foarces by sea with those of the united provinces should giue him too great a shake strange intelligence and corespondence with neighbour friends and allies will alwayes proue a safer refuge for england against spain and because all haue a common quarrell to his ambition and greatnes which in him will never giue way to any other consideration whatsoever for there hath ever been and will still continue in spain an endlesse ambitious desire of the obtayning the westerne monarchy vvhere of a greate parte of christendome doth yet beare the scarre and feele the stripes trade will be allowed to continue and as safely without the alliance of marriage as with it for spayn doth not only reape a benefit by it but also will be afrayde to scare or discontent england by the evill usage of the marchants else why haue they so basely and abjectly begged a peace whesoever he shall se his opportunity and finde a greater aduantage to break then to continue in good termes with england the alliance vvill secure the merchants no more then if it were not at all the states may in time grow great and their greatnes may grow dangerous but spayn is both the one and the other already and this alliance will ad much unto it there may also grow yealousy and unkindnes and thence open emnity betwixt england and them and so on the other side may the matter be so discreetly caried as they two may entertaine good amity and correspodency one with the other for common defence for they both professe one religion and their estate and condition seemes to unite them together in a necessity of putting out their hands one to another for mutuall preservation doe they carry themselves now unkindly or somewhat unrespectiuly it doth not so urgently prove that they may become enemies hereafter as there upon to ground a necessity of making an alliance with a known enemy which were no other but to run into a present mischeif for fear of a future inconvenience they take an allarum at englands ioyning with spayn to their hurt which though it be not so ment by england yet it is the scope that spayn aymes at and that may make them perhaps somewhat to neglect england but remoue the cause and the effect will cease let them be assured of their freindship and they will prove respectfull freinds if they prosper and grow great who knoweth whether it be not of god by such weake meanes to pull downe the loftines of spayn and then to withstand them were to run against a rock the very first occasion of their liberty was driving them to dispaire which made them to take hart and resolution to resist the violence that was offered wherein being incoraged with good successe and feeling their owne strength they haue in time made such further progresse as is this day to be seene better it were for england to make use of a necessary evill and run a course with them whereby they may haue their part in their well speeding then to ioyne with spayn a religion and state enimy who allieth him selfe to england but for his ovvne ends and must needes draw after them the overthrow of the cause of religion and ruine the state and will never proue but a secrett enimy and doubtfull frend and it must not in this place be forgotten that if true professors be justly reproved for going to law before heathen iudges much lesse may they side themselves with any of those that are without to the hinderance and hurt one of an other if england and fraunce should match together it doth not therefore consequently follow that the french should become burthensome to the state by reason of their nearnesse the lawes of england allow no offices or preferments of aliens the french will haue more hope in their owne cuntry where there is without comparison more to be given then in england the english seeke not to make any fortune in scotland but if the french should be importunate they are also impatient let them finde visage de boyes and your couldnes should weare out their earnestnes that the french with the scottish faction may gather strength by the alliance of france is but a particular consideration against which may be opposed the greatnes the spanish faction will grovv unto by a match vvith spayn to the danger of the state this doth greatly lay open the value of such advantages as england doth promise it selfe by matching with spain vvhich how dearely they vvould notvvithstanding be bought will more perfectly appeare if knowledg be also taken of the inconveniences and mischeifes that vvould follovv for the better conceiving vvhere of his ends are to be considered and seriously examined for it is not likely that spain a religion and state catholique vvho hath both religion and state quarrels against england vvill yeald to giue his daughter in mariage to england nay rather doth offer great sums of mony for composing there of but that he looks for a great returne timeo danaos et dona ferentes the price of this alliance therefore vvill be the breaking of the match vvith france to the vveakning of both england ane fraunce vvhereby he may have the greater footing in eyther and the deviding england from his alices especially from the states of the united porovinces the making vvay for an other match for his second sonne vvhom he hath a plot to settle in the lovv cuntries and from thence to promote him if he can to the crovvne imperiall vvith an other daughter of france vvhich vvould giue so great an allarum to the vvhole state of those of the religion if the pretended match vvith england come not betvveen altering in time the state of religion vvhereof if he had no hope neither vvould he harken to the match for none must thinke he vvould treat such an alliance vvithout the privacy and consent of his divines or that they vvill giue their consents to that but upon great probability that it shall tend to the furtherance of their catholique faith the supposed catholique religion is knovvne to be in spain one of the fundamentall lavves of their estate and no doubt spain is a very right romish catholique the further therefore that he spreadeth his religion the greater satisfaction it is to his conscience and the more doth he underprop and increase his greatnes namely because those of that religion that are most deuout but especially the greatest part of the clergy throughout christendom haue their eyes fixed on him as upon the greatest stay and piller of their catholique faith vvho therefore if he should match vvith an heritique for so they terme us english but vvith a setled purpose by such meanes to root out heresy vvould both vvrong his ovvne conscience and loose his reputation amongst all those of his beleefe to the over great vveakning of his estate vvhich error none of sound judgment that knovves spayn vvill easily beleve that he vvill commit that a change or tolleration should happen in england by meanes of the intended match is more to be feared then any can vvarrant to be impossible vvherin it vvere vvell vvorth the laboure to find out vvhat hope spayn doth ground upon and vvhat possibility there is that the same may be disapoynted in the mean time very likely it is in generall that there vvill be no meanes unattempted or left on his side to bring his purpose to passe and then it must in this place be remembred first that vvhatsoever is not of fayth is sin and that sin hath no promise of blessing nor is this a vvork of fayth and next that england hath but too much experience of popery vvith in these fevv yeares for vvant of due execution of the lavves vvhich hath bread exceeding great bouldnes in the papists asvvell at home as abroad if the mariage goe forvvard they vvill take the more hart and greater encouragement no small number of subiects want teaching and so are the more easily shaken many waver and many are newfangled the more prepared for a chaunge therefore will accordingly be wrought upon the ould serpent will seduce many eves and pistols will have free passage every where the worst is yet that there will be party children for the mother will give herselfe noe rest till she have nusled some of them in her owne religio which would make the way very playn easy for a chaunge because the head once corrupted the infection will in short time spread it selfe over the whole body and true religion is unsociable to sort it selfe with false worship and will soone forsake his dwelling place if spayn can procure a tolleration of religion vvhich must needs be follovved vvith ruine of the state he may then assure himselfe of sides that vvill alvvayes be able either directly or indirectly to divert the state from hindering his designes as vvell in the lovv cuntryes as vvheresoever else and although he should not prevayle at the first by practis or procure a tolleration of religion vvhich neverthelesse the increacing number of papists will of it selfe in processe of time effect yet when he hath once a faction on foote and that many of the subjects are perverted in religion he will notwithstanding be in good hope that the state may be stayed hindered fro opposing it self against his designes by the working of his factio the ielousy that will be coceaved of the papists within the relme and whether his hopes will fayll him or no yet if he should upon such ground make any attempt against those of the united provinses that could not but fale out to the great troble annoyance and danger of the state especially if he send his forses by sea for then must england upon any such occation either rig out there navy to sea to se that he keep his course which will allwayes be a matter of great burthen and charge or otherwayes abide the danger of his landing upon their owne cousts if he have intelligence with the papists wherefore it will be allwayes safer in such cases to be somewhat iealous then too secure now the alliance with spayn vvill not onely scarr and discourage in generall the vvholl side of those of the religion abroad to the great vveakning of the state of england but also breed a particuler ielousy in those of the united provinses vvhen they shall se that popery increaseth or that spayn hath a faction or party in the relme vvhereof one of these tvvo mischeives must consequently follovv either that they will make their peace vvith spayn or keep continually many shipes of vvar in the narrovv seas if they be able to hould out especially upon the comming of any supplyes by sea to the artch duke during the truce vvhich as they are a people iealous and suspitious enough by nature may at one time or other by occationes happening grovv to some dangerous inconvenience for betvveen tvvo so neare neighbours both potent at sea if there be not straight amity kept things cannot long stand vvithout breaking forth into tearmes of open hostility and for the state of those provinses though strong by sea alliance and cituation yet are not the foundations of it so far sure that england can vvith safety leaue them to themselves for the late sects and questions about matters of religion threaten their disunion and spayn that lies continually in wayt for their liberty hath his pencioners and dayly practicers amongst them some doe noyse much the antient amity with the house of burgundy but that house is changed and hath not kept strok in the conditions of the alliance so ought the cause to be altered too it was to weak for france but now it is too strong and england had then plots against france which now it hath not the greatest use of leagues and alliances is to prevent present mischeives or to further some necessary enterprice otherwise reason of state and common experience teacheth to sway even with the vveaker for the brideling of the ambition and greatnes of the stronger they make an idle distinction vvho to avoyd the obiections made against spayn pretend that mariages are but personall amongst preinces and not reall for if there be no reallity vvhere is then the good of england if there be any who is so weak as to thinke that spayn will easily quit his interest in it to alledge the exampell of erance that houldeth correspondency still vvith his other allies and continues to assist them against sapyn notvvithstanding his match vvith spayn is to as litle purpose in the judgment of those vvho doe also knovv hovv much spayn prevayleth in weakning their sinewes and frustrating the effect of such assistance the sum is that spayn hopes by reason of this match so to charme england as it shall give way to him in his courses and england contrariwise promiseth it selfe the hony of the bee without danger of being stung whether of both may come short of their recconing is at the least disputable for spayn on the one side will spare no travell or charge will use all the meanes and practises he can and take the benefit of all occasions and advantages that shall be offered to bring his purposes to passe as it may be supposed that england for his part will stand upon his watch to prevent a mischeife that shall threaten the state spayn may by a vigilant care and good foresight be disapoynted so may england by the contrary be overtaken for death will weare away these watchmen that are now and others may succeed that will not be so watchfull nay watchfulnes it selfe overwatched will in time grow drowsy and overwearied carefulnes will grow carelesse the very best cautions and caveats must needes relent and wax ould in time in all strife and contentions as well of the body as the mind if one side get ground the other looseth it time will bring forth many accidents which may fall out as to the good so to the hurt of england who that may with good reason be feared will not be watchfull nor have his spirits alwayes intent enough to prevent the practises of spayn after so straite alliance that cannot now so much as foresee them or resolue to keep out spayn whereupon the question ariseth whether it be a sound course for england not constrayned by any urgent necessity to put the cause of religion and their owne well doing and safety to so great an adversary in a matter that stands upon so many contingents for it is no new experience that the things which we think almost impossible and therefore fear them least doe neverthelesse often come to passe because neglected and so not hindered by opposition they creep unawares upon us as through the mists of security well saith the italian therefore quell che non volete che sia non fate cosa per che avuenga to conclude spayn who of late was thought to decline weak in the head and wounded in reputation by those of the united provinces yet having never been more weakly ballanced then at this present begins now to resume his spirits and without timely and strong opposition will take so deep roote and spread his branches so far as to overshadow all his neighbours and deadly dangerouse it will be for any one to sleepe in

inhabitants of this sinfull land out of the depth of our miseries and from under the burthen of our manifold afflictions and oppressions which we worthily suffer for our iniquities from thy righteous hand  for thou hast psal tryed us and melted us in the fornace even as silver thou hast brought us into the net thou hast layd affliction upon our loynes thou hast caused men to ride over our heads so as to whom shall we goe forhos healing but to thee who hast smitten us to whom for binding up but to thee who hast broken and torne us we doe therfore in this our humbled estate present our complaint before thee thegen iudge of all the world yea before thee who hast aheb feeling of our infirmities having been in all things tempted like as we are yet without sinne to that end that we might come boldly to the throne of grace and obtaine mercy and find grace to helpe in time of need and although we thy people have had of long time and still have much matter of complaint unto thy righteous throne yet now above all other when the throne of iniquity frameth mischiefe as by a law for a synod hath been by authority of late holden wherein such things have been concluded and confirmed as tend to the utter rooting out of all true religion and that under the vaile of deep hypocrisie double iniquity and now  lord give thy people leave even to spread this whole synod before thee as once king ezech  spread the blasphemous letter of the enemy before the l  rd and forasmuch as the said synod hath been both called authorized and confirmed in all the canons and constitutions therof by the king as himselfe declareth by his own act both before and after the said canons wherein he professeth himselfe to be thy deputy  king of kings and lord of lords we therfore think it our duty first to purge our selves of that staine of disloyalty and disobedience which the king chargeth us withall for they lay it to the charge of some of us at the least that we suspect our king of being perverted in a superstitious way of gods worship as if he intended to bring in some alteration of religion in our land against his sundry publicke declartions and sacred professions before him whose deputy saith he we are against all and every intention of any popish innovation now for our parts we doe appeale to thy righteous judgement o searcher of all hearts whether we have been apt causelessely to suspect or surmise the least evill of our king but on the contrary have been ready to interpret all his actions in such a sense as perswading our selvs whatever things were amisse in church or commonweale or whatever innovations brought in yea although under the name of royall authority yet the king was ignorant of them and his name therin abused by some bad officers about him yea how unwilling are we to this very day notwithstanding the late synod so called and confirmed by the king to conceive the least sinister thought of him so as we are apt to thinke that those innovations brought in since and under his raigne have either crept in by stealth and by degrees without his knowledge or been craftily suggested as being no innovations at all but rather renovations of the decayes of the old religion so  ulgarly called being induced thereunto by the ancient use thereof retained in some places of the land since the reformation as especially in the ro  all chappels and cathedralls though not confirmed by any law as the use of altars images and the like but now when we see with open eyes to our hearts grief those things to be concluded as by a law canons of prelats now being made binding laws and so confirmed by the letter  patents of the king for him his heires and lawfull successors o lord what shall we think nay when we see a strict oath injoyned and imposed upon all ministers of what style or ranke soever and upon all graduates in the universities c to approve and preserve the doctrine and discipline or government as it stands now established in the church of england and knowing that by publick acts edicts decr  es declarations books c set forth and published in the kings name and patronized by his speciall authority royall the sanctification of thy christian sabbaths the morality of thy holy commandements the doctrines of thy grace and gospel with the preaching thereof all preaching on thy dayes in the afternoons and all true catechising mainly cryed down and that all thy painfull and godly ministers are persecuted suspended deprived cast out of all and can have no remedy either by course of law which is stopped or by the king himselfe to w  om they complaine and that the prelates of late more especially usurped a false title to their false government ecclesiasticall by claiming their prelaticall jurisdiction from thine own divine authority so as we cannot be any longer ignoran  except we will be wilfully blind that the doctrine of the church of england established in queene elizabeths dayes hath now suffered not onely an innovation but an utter eversion and extirpation of the very foundations thereof and this innovation this eversion being now finally concluded on in a synod confirmed by the king and injoyned to be sworne unto by all those aforesaid and besides all this the king himselfe professing that he hath diligently with great contentment and comfort read and considered of all the said canons orders ordinances and constitutions of the late synod aforesaid and that he finds the same such as he is perswaded wilbe very profitable to the whole church and kingdome and thereupon doth propound publish and straightly injoyne by his authority and letters patents the same to be diligently observed executed and equally kept of all his subjects within this realme now  lord all these things weighed and layd together solemne and sacred protestations against innovations on the one side and a mighty flood of innovations on the other side which by royall authority have made a terrible universall invasion and irruption both into thy spirituall kingdome and this temporal threatning speedily to sweep all away at once what shall we thinke or what shall we say wouldst thou have us still to dreame or imagine that here are no innovations at all brought in either of doctrine or ecclesiasticall government and all because the king hath so frequently so solemnly before g  d and angels and men protested to the contrary or that the innovations concluded in this synod are therfore no innovations because ratified and confirmed by the kings letters patents and by all the strength of royall authority and because commended by the king to be such as he is perswaded wilbe very profitable to the whole church and kingdome or may we not rather thinke or rather most certainly beleeve that for the iniquities of the land oppression in the state persecutions of thy ministers effusion of innocent blood of thy servants open profanation of thy sabbaths and that by publicke dispensation yea in a word a contemptuous trampling of all laws divine and humane underfeet nay yet more  more especially as the orginall source and cause of all the rest a damnable apostacie from the gospel joyned with a desperate league with rome too palpable to be seen so as antichrists religion is imbraced instead of thy true word and gospell for this for these crying sins is it not lawfull for us to thinke at least yea to beleeve that thou in thy just judgement restrained and withheld from us the benigne influence of the kings heart and hast so farre for a time at least for our humiliation given him up to be seduced by the prelates and their romish faction and to be guided and led by their councels as refusing to hearken to any true information of his most loving and loyall subjects whereof we have had of late lamentable experience he will rather hazard all his kingdomes then either displease them or disobey their councels but yet  lord seeing thy judgements are unsearchable and thy wayes past finding out we will not take upon us to judge in so deep a matter onely thou hast sayd you shall know them by their fruits but lord the king saith he doth these things by his prerogative royall and supreme authority in causes ecclesiasticall holy and righteous lord hast thou given to any mortall creature to any kings on earth any such prerogative royall any such supreme authority over thy church as to alter religion at his pleasure or to confirme the alteration of the true religion for others pleasure to make voyd by edicts or declarations the saving doctrines of thy word thy holy commandements thine eternall law or to sit in thy throne over the soules and consciences of thy people captivating and oppressing them under the burthens of humane inventions and superstitious ceremonies nay hast thou not expreslycol to the end of the chapter forbidden thy people to subject their necks under any such yoake as being a denyall of thee our king and of our redemption by thy precious blood such usurpations therfore of man we doe  onely soveraigne of our soules even before angels and men utterly renounceesa o lord our god other lords besides thee have had dominion over us but by thee onely will we make mention of thy name and lord be thou our judge between us and our oppressors in this thing and give thy people holy courage and zeale to use all lawfull meanes for the upholding of this thy sole royall soveraignty over our poor soules and consciences against all antichristian usurpations to the contrary and last of all whereas our king saith that he hath called and given free leave to this synod to treat and agree upon certaine other canons necessary for the advancement of gods glory the edifying of his holy church and the due reverence of his blessed mysteries and sacraments which words are taken out of the act for conformity in queen elizabeths raigne if it shall clearly appeare by this our complaint following that the things concluded in the said synod be neither for the advancement of gods glory nor the edifying of his church nor the due reverence of christs holy mysteries and s  raments but quite contrary then how the kings authority extends to the confirmation of those things therein so concluded do thou  lord judge in the next place we present our complaint before thee  lord touching the most materiall canons concluded by the  id synod and confirmed by the king the first is concerning the regall power   or absolute as all tyrannicall states as that of the turke seeing the kingdome of england is  empered seasoned and conditioned with good laws which are the ordinary rules of good and just government of the subject the due execution whereof in the administration of the kingdome is an essentiall part of the kingly  ffice which cannot be seperated one from the other to this purpose king iames in  speach at  speec  es in parliament expresly distinguisheth between an absolute monarchie not bounded with laws but depending onely on the will of the prince and the king of england who saith he doth by  that by oath  nter upon the kingdome to  page of their estates let him but call a parliament and yeeld to the redressing of their heavy grievances and he shall find us his people most ready to yeeld him all manner of necessary due support yea abundant more then necessary  paragraph yet neverthelesse subjects have not onely possession of c againe what assurance of true and just right title and property to and in all their goods and estates can this their canon as it were by canonlaw make unto the subjects of england when all then practises both in the ecclesiasticall and civill government are such such the courses of their courts whether ecclesiasticall or mixt as consisting of ecclesiasticall and civil judges together but still where the ecclesiasticall beare the maine sway even there where they be fewest in number such their usurped illegall extravagant power such terrible precedents filed up in their courts which stand for laws and ruled cases for all that come after and the like as no subject in the kingdome can secure himselfe that any one thing or all that he possesseth are his owne for the best and surest tenure by which every freeborne subject holds the right and propriety of his goods is the law of the land but let the subject be brought into one of their eccl  siasticall courts as aforesaid whether into their highcommission or other courts where the archprelates sit party iudges and be his cause never so just never so innocent never so cleare as against which no law of the land doth lye yet first of all in those courts he cannot have any benefit of the law at all and consequently where those ecclesiasticall judges set their fangs they will teare a man out of all his est  e yea out of his skin and pull his flesh from his back and breake him and his all in pieces so as at those boards where these harpies sit against whomsoever complaints are served in being such especially as whe  the eccl  siasticall teeth against them how quickly shall they and their whole estates be swallowed up as it were at one morsell and to the end that the civil state may be subservient to the ecclesiasticke these ecclesiasticks have their care in every b  te and their finger in every pye where any thing may be pluckt from the subject by hocke or by crooke that so as their ecclesiastick government is tyrannicall so they may advance the civil to hold correspondence with it so as now the whole government taken together is reduced to certaine tall  s even as all religion is served up upon a courtcu  bord at the end of the chan  cel wherof anone and as is noted before which least it be forgotten we mention againe whatever conclusions or orders are made at those tables or boards  e they never so foule and shamefull they are fixed and filed up for perpetuall laws in all such cases for time to come yea and when they please where they want a precedent for some extraordinary feat to be done they can with a wet finger make a new law for it hereof if we take but a few instances it will easily appeare what truth there is in the words of this canon which seem to give to the subject what ever right and title and true property of estate doth or can belong unto them for first we have late precedents to shew that no freeman of london after he hath served his yeares and set up his trade can be sure long to injoy the liberty of his trade but either he is forbidden longer to use it or is forced at length with the rest of his trade to purchase it as a monopolie at a deare rate which they and all the kingdome pay for witnesse the sopebusinesse againe no doctor and practitioner in physicke is sure to hold his profession whereby he and his should live when once he comes into the high commission witnesse dr bastwicks case item no minister is sure to hold his freehold his benefice which is by law his freehold if once he be quarrelled in the high commission yea or in other inferiour ecclesiasticall courts witnesse manifold precedents in the land item none can be sure that his goods are his owne when all and more then all are taken from  witnesse mr henry bu  ton one of the foresaid three item none can be sure of his right and title propriety and interest which the divine law and sacred ordinance of god hath given a man in his own wife but that one of these boards shall  him as by vertue thereof being confined to perpetuall  prison his wife shalbe perpetually seperated from him so as if she shall dare to hazzard her life in a far  e  ourney by sea which she would doe to have but a sight o  her husbands face she must be sent prisoner backe againe witnesse the case both of dr bastw  cke and mr burton aforesaid many more instances might be brought but these summed up together let any english subject now resolve what assurance o  true and just  ight title and property to and in all their goods and estates or in any of the particular instances forespecified this false and wicked canon can give him let him be but brought before one of these boards and he shalbe stript of all they will pretend this and that i wot not what he  nous crime  as they did against those three aforesaid when they could not prove any such thing and mr burtons case in particular being a minister was so cleare his defensive answere being orderly admitted in court and before the day of  by the courts order expanged by two of the judges o  that court as impertinent and scandalous as they could object nothing against him at the censure but proceed against him pro confess  all his fault being his refusa  l to answere  interrogatories which if he had done he had betrayed his cause and layd both it and himselfe open to the just lash of the court by assenting to the condemnation of his innocent cause before it was heard which one example well weighed what cause so innocent so just can look to escape scot free but thus we see  lord and thou better seest what truth these canonists have in them whose words pretend all right to the subject and whose deeds doe practise the bringing of all mens soules bodies and estates under the yoake of an universall tyranny to proceed for the third the setting up of an independent coactive power papall or popular which undermines they say the royall office and cunningly overthrows the sacred ordinance of godthis being meant of the state of religion if it be papall it is altogether unlawfull as being antichristian but being according to thy word every christian state is bound to  it up and maintaine it and no christian king ought to hinder or oppose it but as for all pre  it is meerly papall and antichristian though not in the first degree the pope usurping an universall power over all the churches in the world yet in a second every prelate in his diocese exercising a papall power and so doth cunningly undermine the royall office and overthrew gods sacred ordinance who hath given a power and charge to kings to suppresse all such ecclesiasticall tyranny over the soules of his people and whereas they say the royall office is the sacred ordinance of god we all acknowledge it and that this ordinance of god comprehends in it not onely the institution of the superiority of kings over their people but their speciall office of government as it is limited and establish  d upon those laws and covenants and conditions agreed upon between the prince and people these are a speciall part of thy divine ordinance  that kings should governe by a law as deut pro and that they should inviolably keep those oathes and covenants that they have solemnly made with their people and therefore they which perswade kings that they are no way boun  but have liberty to rule as they list by an independent prerogative these are they that are traytors both to god and to the king and to the realme and to the peace and prosperity thereof for the fourth for subjects not to beare armes against their king offensive or defensive upon any pretence whatsoever as being a resi  ing of the powers ordained of god first we hold that no private person ought to take up armes against his prince but secondly if a king maintaine a faction about him which goe about to oppresse  s whole kingdome  and people in their law  and liberti  s and most of all in the true religion so as he will not rule them by the good laws of the kindome but seeks to make all his subjects slav  s by bringing their soules bodies estates  a miserable bondage is it not now high time for the whole state either to labour to heale the breach or if necessity when there is no other remedy to stand up is one man to defend themselves and their countrey untill the faction shalbe  cashe  ed and so the king reforme himselfe and renew  covenant and  of the kingdome to the good and just  of the people and wheras  i is point trencheth upon the scots at this time what doe they stand upon but in the first place to free their religion from antichristan usurpa  on  psal  which otherwise by  and tyranny would be brought to  and for the f  st and last that all ministers doe declare this consatution of the power of kings to the people yearely ought not ministers to consider that they are also members of the commonwealth and live under the law thereof and being subjects ought they not to teach the people that they love and h  nour the king and chearefully pay all such taxes as by law are due unto him forasmuch as we all live under a law and  the other side ought not all courtpreachers to tell the  christian and lawlesse government and this  lord we conceive of this first constitution so farre as we are able to apprehend committing the whole judgement thereof to thy uner  ing wisdome the second is for the better keeping holy the day of his majesties most happy inauguration ah lord can this be to the honour of our king when the annuall memory of his inauguration is saine to be forced what canon or constitution is for the continuation of the joyfull memory of queen elizabeth of ever blessed memory which yet to this day ceaseth not but o that our king would consider that word of thine sam those that honour me i will honour and they  and then they might have spared this canon for the king  s day no no if these things be not reformed aie  blacke day is hastening on a pace as thou  lord hast threatned in thy word for such sinnes and with thee there is no respect of persons ier  king ieh  jachim lived without being desired and had the  of an asse and it was written upon him write this man childlesse a man that  h  ll not presper in the earth nor should be lamented being dead nor should any of i  seed prosper after him o how terrible art thou  lord to proud and obstinate sinners when not kings crowns and scepters can secure of defend them from thy just hand and how fearefull a judgement is that when thouiob powrest contempt upon princes and weakenes  the power of the mighty the third canon is for suppressing of the growth of popery o lord dost thou not see in this whole long canon the naked hypocrisie of this synod clothing it selfe with many same figleaves of pious pretences forsooth for the suppressing of popery yea lord their  ypocrisie is so palp  ble herein that all the world sees that this constitution was purposely made to blind the eyes of the simple in these stirring times wherin they see their popish practises to grow into such hatred and detestation with all the kings good subjects what other but these practises have been the co  les that have kindled the fire in our neighbour  page to make the greater report but without shot in so hotly assaulting the tower of babel because in so doing it may make the world beleeve that contrary to the doctrine of canterbury there is no salv  tion for papists out of the church of england and then let all court papists looke to it and withall the president must  a great part of his relation which he hath written in favour of papists especially  silly and ignorant to whom he grants salvation in their r  igion he must also retract his saying that the church of england and of rome are one and the same church and hold one faith and religion undifferent he must also  that wherein he assemeth with his iesuite relat p that none  ght to come to the english church then and there in that manner to worship god that is resolved of the truth of the roman church or to the like effect and the relator himself holds the truth of the roman church for he affirmeth it to be a true church with many other new leaves which he must turne over upon this suddaine motion of suppressing the growth of popery which if cordiall they should first have rid all churches from images crucifixes  altars and the like least in bringing papists to church they should but change their latine popery into english popery and now  lord we beseech thee to judge of the hypocrisie of this selfestyled sacred synod which under a pretence of suppressing the growth of popery doe indeed supplant the true faith and religion amongst us that so instead thereof they may at length as fast as they can set idolatry up in her throne and full  for besides all this that is said have they not set out many notorious popish books as that called the femall glory which makes the blessed virgin to be a goddesse to be adored and called upon or prayed unto the whole booke being a very packe of idolatry throughout and set out in english and allowed by one of the prime prelates chapleins so also a booke of one shelford priest whose treatises are notorious grosse popery with many other of the same branne or meale which have been published by authority and never any of them yet called in and some that have been called in as cozens orisons and salis his devotions and others yet go currant up and down and are in every papists pocket now if these holy men of this sacred synod had intended indeed to suppresse the growth of popery they should have caused heaps of bonefires to be made of the bookes in smithfield but in all things touching this point how ridiculously and palpably they have discovered their hypocrisie especially the president and father of the synod doe thou  lord judge the fourth canon is against socinianisme behold here lord another devise to set simples a wondering what this monster soci  isine should be which most men in england never so much as once heard named before and which england i hope  is free enough from unlesse a certaine neighbour to it which they call  rminianis  ne doe not hale it in as it hath done many other heresi  s for as for the remonsirants or a  minians they professe society and communion with the socimans rather then with the orthodox protestants whom they call ca  vinists yea and in sundry of their heresies they border neare upon them as maintaining iustification by works and that we are not bound to beleeve that we shall rise againe with these our bodies glorified and the like so as doth not the synod mistake the name should they not have said against arminianisme or perhaps they name the damnable and cursed heresie of socinianisme both because they would make the people beleeve it is that which hath so much been cryed downe by preachers under the name of arminianisme and yet they will save arminianisme harmelesse to which they have been so much beholden and also because arminianisme doth in many things symbolize with sccinianisme under which it may the more easily lye hid but for arminianisine sake the president hath in a declaration in the kings name before the articles made the articles touching grace election predestination c to speake aswell in favour of it as of the truth it selfe or would they prevent the contagion of socinianisme as also of arminianisme call in those orders which restraine young students in the vniversitie for reading our protestant authors the fifth canon against sectaries in this canon they name seperatists whom especially they meane as indeavouring as they say the subversion of the doctrine and discipline of the church of england on these they lay load in good earnest indeed and on all those that shall print or publish bookes especially against the discipline and government of the church of england this is indeed their faire goddesse diana of which these craftsmen who get their great incomes by her are so jealous and doe so furiously thunder against the opposites and surely  lord if thou dost not at this time helpe they poore people who cannot with a good conscience if but rightly informed hold communion with these men in their discipline and under their government must needs goe to wracke and be utterly spoyled they and theirs the sixt canon an oath injoynd for the preventing of all innovations in doctrine and government ah lord here is the filling up of the measure of all iniquity  ol all cruelty and tyranny when they have brought their plots to passe when established and setled their innovations both in doctrine and government then these hypocrites come with  for the preventing of all innovations in doctrine and government this for the title of the canon and that they may exalt their hypocrisie to the height that it may appeare to all men they further say this present synod being desirous to declare their sincerity and constanc  in the profession of the doctrine and  in the church of england and to secure all then against any suspicion of  volt to popery or any other superstition decr  es c now lord can the hypocrisie of rome it selfe in that mystery of iniquity packed up in the councel of trent surpasse this notorious hypocrisie of our english prelates in this their synod the vaile of their soule hypocriste is the pretence of sincerity and constancie in the profession of the doctrine and dis  ine already established they have now already established a new doctrine and discipline in the church of england and so they are desirous to declare their sincerity and constancie in the profession of the same o holy lord who is able to deale with these impious hypocrites but thy selfe alone and now that they have  tained their ends in a good measure for they do not meane to stay here till they have finished the tower of babel to its full height by degrees after a while they doe this to secure all men against any suspicion of revolt to popery or any other superstition for when the revolt to popery and the superstitions thereof is now in a good measure already made then would they have all men to be secure against any revolt to popery but what need men to feare when the danger is already past and without remedie they have set up their altars they gently intreat adoration thereunto and that by the same arguments that papists use to colour over such idolatry till they have learne  in fuller termes to expresse themselves with a we will and command they have set up their images and crucifixes in chappels and cathedralls and that over the altar for all other churches to conforme thereunto they have published bookes in english full of most grosse romish idolatry and supers  tion they have cryed down the due sanctification of the christian sabbathday and have layd open the s  dg  tes to all pro  anesse to breake in by publike  spensation of profane sports and pastimes that so they make the lords day the  day and to make way for such profane sports they have universally forbid all preaching in the  ernoones upon thy holy day they have made thy holy commandment for the keeping and sanctifying of thy day of none effect and that not onely by their profane practises but professedly by their books published by authority they have by edicts made the articles of r  gion of the church of england concerning grace to be of none authority they have set forth r  lation of a cont  nce by will of canterburie books wherein they professe that the church of england and of rome the whore of babylon are one and the same church professing one and the same faith and religion and goe about to father the antichristian iurisdict  n and government of prelates upon the divin  ution and upon the practise of thy holy apostles and doe cry down the authority of thy sacred word as an insufficient witnesse to prove it selfe the word of  od and as a dead and dumbe judge and insufficient to determine doubt and controversies in points of faith and so doe set up  authority above the scripture they have cast out all or most of those godly and painfull mino  ers of thy word which were as so  lights and pillars in the house of our god because they stood in the gappe and in the way of these men to hinder their wicked attempts in overthrowing of all true religoon and if any good ministers be yet left that have escaped their fingers here is a hellish plot will hurle them all out at a clappe these with many other their inn  vations they having now brought to passe now now would they have all men to be secure against any revolt to popery now they declare their constancie and sincerity in the doctrine and discipline established and hereupon they proceed to their synodicall decree saying this present synod decrees that all archbishops and bishops and all other priests and deacons in places exempt or not exempt shall take an  against all inn  vations of doctrine or discipline and the  i a b doe sweare that i doe approve the doctrine and discipline or government established in the church of england as containing all things necessary to salvation and that i will not indeavour by my selfe or any other directly or indirectly to bring in m  popish doctrine contrary to that which is so established nor will i ever give my assent to alter the government of this church by archbishops bishops deanes and archdeacons c as it stands now established and as by right it ought to stand nor yet ever to subject it to the usurpation and superstitions of the sea of rome c and if any shall refuse to take this oath after the first moneth he shalbe suspended from his ministry after the second moneth from his ministry and benefice and after the third moneth deprived of all his ecclesiasticall promotions whatsoever and execution of his function which he holds in the church of england and so this oath extends to all graduates in divinity masters of graduates or licensed practitioners in law and physicke all registers actuaries proctors schoolmasters all that enter into the ministry or into a benefice c thus lord it is not suffi  for these men to alter both the doctrine and discipline of the church of england as aforesaid and to make the discipline and government of prelates more antichristian then it was before by adding a new claime of divine authority to their antichristian iurisa  ction blasphemoully fatheri  g it upon thee but they must have all this sealed with an oath of all such persons as aforesaid that so by so many condu  pipes the whole land may be poysoned and at once universally enthralled under a most miserable bondage and now subscription which were too much and against all law and conscience is not sufficient for all ministers and others of any degree forementioned must sweare to the ratifying of the  of the articles of religion as aforesaid to the setting up and bowing to altars with all the other ceremonies and innovations about them to the maintaining of an anti christian tyranny exercised by the prelates under the name of christ and his apostles and so in summe they must become sworne vassals to these tyrants and sworne enemies to thy majesty and kingly soveraignty to thy word and scepter to their owne salvation and the salvation of thy people and so proclaime themselves to all the world the most base and vile slaves that ever the earth bred yea the most of them such especially as know anything and this time of light admits of no plea for ignorance in any man must of necessity if at all they take this oath sweare against their own consciences and so in no small degree sin against the holy ghost whereby their sin becomes unpardonable when once their conscience is  eared to impenitencie and their selfedamnation sealed up to destruction besides all this if they looke upon temporall respects are they sure the king of this land will be alwayes of the mind to maintain and continue such an hierarchie what if god should be pleased in mercy to hi  church to open the eyes of the king to let him see now he and his state is abused by this generation of prelates so as to  ot them out againe though the office o  kings be  mortall yet their persons are not another king may succeed that is of another m  d and above all this we beleeve  lord that the intolerable outrages and high flown presumptions of these prelates against thee and thy church and against the whole state of the land are most certaine cleare and immediate forerunners of their most fearefull ruine and therefore let thy feare  lord be upon all thy ministers and people of the land at this time and let thy grace be sufficient for them to arme them with a holy courage zeale magnanimity undaunted constant res  tion to stand out in a christian defiance against this most damnable and desperate oath least the taking of it bring certaine wrath upon the takers as the making and imposing of it shall certainly bring upon the makers and imposers of it to their utterdestruction but alas  lord have not these prelates already made way for an unwer  all admittance of this their cursed oath for where is fearce one good minister left of a true bred masculine spirit whom these men have not rid out of the way and those that be left are they not for the most part such as either preferre the fleshpots of aegypt before canaan or such as have already de  led their consciences with ab  sing their ministry to the publick obeying of wicked commands of these their great masters as in the publick reading the booke of profane sports on the lords day forbearing to preach in the afternoones admitting of altars in their churches and perhaps bowing unto them not  to preach freely the doctrines of grace to the strengthening of the faith of gods people and inflaming their love towards god as the th article saith and to the confounding of the enemies of grace and that cursed faction that now raigneth so as ministers having universally defiled their consciences and abased their ministry in these things for such as refused are already cast out are already prepared and sitted to doe any other base  service that these their masters shall command their conscience being by this time made wide enough to swallow downe this monstrous and damnable oath which could not possibly have been forged in any other shop but in hell it selfe not by any other workmen but by devils themselves in the likenesse of men but  lord thou whoiud  onely art able to keep  thine from saking and to  reserve them faultlesse before the presence of thy glory with joy whoesa wilt keep him in perfect peace whose  nd is stayd on thee because he trusteth in thee if thou hast a remnant left which have not received the marke of the beast but have kept their garments pure or if any who through feare or humane frailty have abased themselves in any of the things aforesaid restore them by repentance and establish them all by thy grace that they may so stand for thy truth and their salvation here as they may one day stand undaunted before the son of man at his appearing and further we note out of the words of the oath that they are to sweare they doe approve the doctrine and  line established in the church of england as containing all things necessary to salvation now will they say that the discipline or government of the church of england containeth any thing necessary to salvation seeing herein they joyne it with doctrine as containing together all things necessary to salvation nay is not the discipline and government any enemy to salvation seeing it is altogether antichristian tyrannicall and a meere usurpation and in the whole practise of it and in all the rites and ceremonies against the word of god and against the doctrine and practise of the apostles and a most notorious and pestilent persecuter of the true saints and servants of god and a rooter out of all true religion and godlinesse out of the land is it not antichristian and usurping christs throne and soveraignty over the consciences of his people which is expresly and directly contrary to the apostles doctrine so as the subjection thereunto is clearely proved by thecol c apostle to be a denying of christ and so a loosing of salvation and for the doctrine of the church of england how can it be sayd to containe all things necessary to salvation when the most principall articles of saving grace are made of none effect and are forbidden to be preached to the people and suppose all the articles were intire and not corrupted but preserved in their true sense agreeing with scripture asarticle of consecration of archbishops c some of them are not yet they cannot be sayd to containe all things necessary to salvation for onely the holy scripture which is the onely ad quate rule of faith containeth all things necessary to salvation it being a cleare commentary and exposition of it selfe and a rule whereby to try all humane writings of divinity whatsoever thus the matter of the oath it selfe is most false and blasphemous which with all the rest we referre to thy judgement  lord againe a man must sweare not to bring in any popish doctrine  n  rary to that which is so established we conceive this to be no  page church secondly for bishops we find the name indeed in  ture but not a diocesan bishop but such a one as   a particular congregation to feed the flocke of god as thy   teacheth and we find deacons also but no archdeacons and to set archdeacons over presbyters is not onely an incoug  ity and disorder and so not right as it ought to be but also a  antichristian guise and usurpation as for deanes they are of a later institution and as for archbishops they confesse that the apo  es were all equall how come they then to be superiour to other diocesan bishops who claime to be the apostles success  by this reckoning an archbishop should have been superiour to the apostl  s so as this archiepiscopall government stands not rightly established as being in a more superlative degree antichristian then ordinary bishops nor can he with them shift or put off their government to be antichristian and papall the metropolitan of all england being that over england which the pope challengeth to be over the church catholicke and that the present archprelate carries himselfe as the pope of england whose canon is a law let but this wicked synod witnesse whereof he is the papall president and this papall oath withall which is drawn up and imposed on all ministers after the manner of that oath which paul the fourth added to his councel   rent for all his clergie to take and so to sweare to all the doctrines and canons concluded in that councel thus  lord we could not but in this perplexed case open our minds and as the prophet saithier  open our cause before thee the seaventh canon a declaration concerning some rites and ceremonies this canon is generally for an uniformity in willworship throughout all england and particularly in the introducing of altars in every church with the service about it the canon for this first pretends how it were to be wished that unity of faith were accompanied with uniformity of practise in the outward worship and service of god now this outward worship is meerly of mans devising a willworship and expresly forbidden and condemned by thecol apostle and therefore no service of god so as the uniformity herein overthroweth not onely the unity of faith but the faith it selfe as col and againe such willworship of mans invention is a fruit of the pride and presumption of mans aine and gracelesse heart and so cannot be truely called the service of god for our god hates all such service as himselfe hath not commanded and prescribed in his word according as thou  againe this s  d pretends for this their wished uniformity in  worship two things the avoyding of suspicious feares of innovation by the weake the hope of papists of englands backes  ding into popish superstition and both by reason of the situation of the communion table and the approaches thereunto and might not the synod then with more ease have removed quite away both the feare of the one and the hope of the other in leting the communion tables stand where they were wont to do when a stumbling blocke stands in a darke way whether is it not better for the preventing of stumbling to remove the blocke then to write upon it beware of this stumbling blocke shall not every man that passeth that way sooner break his shinnes or bones then  ake notice of the writing for prevention and can every one take warning by the canon to avoyd the offence so well as if the scandall were quite taken away when in ezek  his time the people began to worship that monument of the brazen serpent the good king brake it to pieces and is it not better   e now altars to be set up in all c  es throughout england  hereupon the synod tells us for it is conscious enough of it  papists slatter themselves with a hope of our backe  ding into their popish superstition doe they so how come they thus to hope from the seting up of your alt  s you will say and to what purpose then is your former canon for suppressing the growth of popery when this canon will make them grow faster out of a hope of englands backes  ding to them then the former will suppresse their growth for feare of all the emptie charge thereof or for any counterfeit shows these men can make of winning them to our church unlesse the altars be of more force to doe it when they see especially those superstitions or rather idolatrous approaches thereunto but the synod calls their hope a vaine hope thats the synod  vain hope or rather hypocriticall dissimulation for they know it to be most true and the papists have reason so to hope as some of their own authors in their late english pamphlets have jea  ngly writ of englands back  tiding to popery as of a thing whereof england is grown now adayes very ambitious and for the feare and jealousie which they say the weake have hereof have not the wisest men in the king  e the like feare and jealousie and that upon just causes and grounds and suppose the weake onely were offended with such things why did not the wise and sacred  rather remove the scandall then slappe them in the mouth with the fox tayle of   canon or smoke out their cryes with the charge   the strong as saith the apostle ought to beare with the  of the weake and not to please themselves but the synod tells us that the standing of the communiontable  way under the east window of every chancel or chappell i   its  nature indifferent neither commanded nor condemned by the word of god either expresly or by immediate deduction and therfore that no religion is to be placed therein or s  ruple to be made thereon first if it be a thing indifferent why doe they trouble me consciences of their weak  brethren with it who hold it to be a thing scandalous this is against the apostles rule even the rule of charity tending to the destruction of mens soules secondly if a thing indifferent why are they so eagre for it when it may as well be forborne and especially at this time when both the kingdomes and the wisest men therein are so troubled with it the  eace disturbed the state distracted and the kingdomes hazarded thirdly if it be indifferent why doe they not so leave it why doe they alter the nature of it turning the indifferencie into a necessity as they doe with all their other ceremonies which they professe to be in their own nature indifferent yet turne them out of their nature and make them necessary and so intolerable burthens to mens consciences yea why doe they force all ministers to take a solemne oath that they approve these things as necessary to be observed but neither is this they so urge a thing in its own nature indifferent namely whether the communiontable stand sideway under the east window of every chancel for first it is a communion table and therefore to stand in the midst where all may sit about it as about a table and thus it is rightly and properly a communiontable it is not a communioncubbord or a communion dresser to stand sideway to the wall thats no communion table and consequently such a standing sideway to the wall of every chancel is by immediate deduction condemned in the word of god for the word of god calls and commends and commands this by the name of the lords table and so it commands withall the proper use of it as of the table of the lord but the standing of this table sideway to the wall takes away not onely the nature and indeed the name of a table but also the proper use of the lords table where every one of his family is to sit about it as david saith  thy children like olive plants round about thy table  for such is the right and proper use of a table and therefore as the scripture commands and commends unto us the lords table with the right use thereof as is sutable to the nature of it so by necessary consequence and immediate deduction the scripture condemnes any such posture or placing therof as altee  both the nature and use of the lords table so as it is not a thi  g indifferent whether the table stand sideway to the wall for it ought not so to stand seeing it is a perverting of the nature and use of the table of the lord and so a perverting of the lords ordinance againe not indifferent for all chancels alike for in many vast churches the people cannot heare when their priest sayes or sings his second service at his new altar as he is injoyned unlesse the ordinary be more mercifull to the congregation were it a mercy to communicate with superstitious worship and service againe the word of god eze expresly condemnes in his people the  mitation of the heathen in their idolatry or superstition or to doe after their manner so as such guises are not things indifferent now for the standing of the communion table sideway to the east wall is to place it like to popish altars which are altars of idolatry like to those of the heathen and so is a faire inducement by degrees of their idolatrous sacrifice too for all the faire pretences the synod makes to the contrary and doth not the synod confesse that at the time of reformation of this church from that grosse superstition of popery it was carefully provided that all meanes should be used to root out of the minds of the people both the inclination thereunto and memory thereof especially of the idolatry committed in the masse for which cause all popish altars were demolished then we aske thy synod why they are here so zealous in seting up the communion table sideway to the east wall after the manner of popish altars seeing before they pretend such care and zeale for the suppressing of the growth of popery and for the bringing of papists to the english church where when they come and presently see a thing set up sideway at the east end of the chancel just like their highaltar and seeing withall the people or priest lowly lowting unto it or devoutly bowing before it or toward it are they not hereby straight put in mind of their old romish idolatry enough to make them presently to turne papists againe where is then the carefull provision of this synod that all meanes be used to root out of the minds of such both the inclination and memory of the idolatry of the masse for which cause our ancient reformers caused all romish altars to be demolished  page times in the place where the altars formerly stood but in time of of  in the midst of the church or chancel and yet the  u  ction did not necessarily tye the table to stand at all other times saving at the communion at the end of the chancel but for most conveniencie according to the discretion of the minister and gardians and certainly the good queens intent never was are could be that that standing so at other times should be a precedent for aftertimes to introduce altars againe there to have a fixed station and so to become a stumbling blocke to protestants and a laughing stock to papists causing the one to feare innovations and the other to hope our backesliding into popish superstation and that the table hath stood so ever since unremoved in the royall chappels there is not the same reason of a chappel and of a church a chappel wanting conver  ent roome to place the table in the midst although this was to be imputed rather to want of care in the deane of the chappel then want of roome in the chappel as in many other things besides and as for cathedra  churches most of them had the tables standing in the midst of the chancel untill of very late dayes and under this kings rugne wherein our prelates have been more stick  ing then ordinary to erect not only altars but crucifixes and images in all cathedralls and now their project plainly appeares to be this that by these mother churches as they call them they might introduce altars into all other churches to verifie the proverbe like mother like daughter and whereas they name  ome parochiall churches to have had altars this hath been but of late dayes too since this fashion began to be renewed but when they have summd up all together it will not amount to the acquitting this generation from illegality or from more then suspicion and that  ust both of romish superstition and  dolatry to boo  as also of a great innovation of the state of the church both in doctrine and discipline for first for the royall chappel what are they to an universality if the king should have misse in his chappell must therefore every church in the land have so too and so for cathedralls what are they bu  as i  were the chappels or chancels of the bishop d  ane and chapter parishchurches they are no  no nor yet motherchurches as whereof other churches are begotten but are  the very dennes of the dragon and the styes to fa   be  for the slaughter and because some par  hia  churche  by some ministers of the bishops faction have lately  altars is this sufficient to acquit them of  egalify  of  of r  mish superstition and idolatry in making hereupon a canon for the sitting up of altars in all the churches of england dare these  bring this their mettall to be tryed in a parliamenttes  where they should find refiners of suffi  judgement to sever the  silver if there were any from the dr  sse but when they have se  up their tables sidewayes to the easti  ll shall they stand there fixed shall they not be moveables still as in queen elizabeths time and according to her injunction at least be  t in the midst of the church or chancel a  the comm  for this they tell us we judge it fit and convenient that all churches and chappels do conforme themselves in th  particular to the example of the cath  drall or mother churches saving alwayes the generall liberty lest the bishop by law during the time of the administration of the holy communion a plausible perswasion of these hyp  es they thinke it fit therefore who will not thinke it so they heartily commend it and what is this but a commandpe  anagke e  s  a  necessa  but thy holy apostle  lord in the samec  chapter where he speakes against rites and ceremonies w  nes thy people to take heed that they be  oncun  vented p  anolegia with  ticeing words or faire speeches and what fugared words be here in  canon to merce thy people to  idolatro  and superstitious rites and ceremonies here commended for what be these rites and ceremonies namely as the seting up of a  high altar so adoration thereunto this is that which these hypocrites thinke and commend for very fit and behoofull pretending therein service done to thy majestie when it is indeed a service that pleases them and which to thy dishonour and against thy will and word they will force upon thee as the heathen man sayd of the false gods in his timepythaga  eus  b praep  euang lib cap spara gnomen a  nagkazethai theous tais anthropinais boulais doul  uein that the gods against their mind were constrained to serve mens wills namely in mans devised willworship and thus doe these imitators of the blind heathen force thee to serve their  while they set up a service of their owne fancie as both in seting up altars and commending worship to them though pretended as done to thee even as the false oracles of old  cap  ten apsukon hulen  ebem prosetation commanded men to worship a piece of wood or such like matter wherein was no life but these lying oracles these hypocrites pretend such worship is to honour thee withall o bold impiety o notorious hypocrisie these are the men that trample thy word under their feet that cast it out of the church that stoppe thy ministers mouthes and consequently thy peoples eares that they cannot heare thy lively voyce speaking unto them to the saving of their poore soules and instead hereof they give unto them a flappe with a foxtayle for instead of honouring thee in thine own sacred and saving ordinance they commend to thy people these superstitious and idolatrous services as the fruits of their pro  d and profane popish hearts which they commend as most fit and beho  full nowezech wilt thou not judge them  lord wilt thou not judge them cause them to know their abominations and give them the reward of selfepleasure now we know that all cathedrall or those mother churches have their altars fixed and never removed no not in time of communion by this law of conformity therefore all parechiall churches must have their tables fixed and never to be removed no not at the communion and so being fixed they cease now to be any longer tables but put on the nature of altars which stand perpetually fixd onely here is one helpe peradventure for it if the bishop be pleased to give liberty to parishes to remove the table into the midst  r the communion this liberty alwayes saved so as here is all the hope of parishes in this matter yet what hope when the bishop shall answere such suiters ye are a sort of puritans will you be wiser then your motherchurch or wiser then the sacred and holy synod who judged it fit and convenient that all churches and chappels doe conforme themselves in this particular to the example of th  cathedrall or mother churches and though the law give him a generall liberty in this to grant it or no yet he holds himselfe rather bound by the canon in this case not to give liberty then dispensed to take and use liberty by the law but yet for all this the synod gives one remedy as to thinke never a whit the worse of the table or to be out of conceit with it because being thus fixed it seems to be quite turned from a table into an altar for it addeth and we declare that this situation of the holy table doth not imply that it is or ought to be esteemed a true and proper altar whereon christ is againe really sacrificed but it is and may be called an altar by us in that sense in which the primitive church called it an altar and in no other a holy table doe these holy men call it but shall we thinke it ever a whit the holyer that it stands now fixed sideway to the wall yes for it is now an altar yet not a true and proper altar as whereon christ is againe really sacrificed no so the papists in some sense will say for their altars but what say they to this doe they not meane it is such an altar as without which the sacrifice or offering upon it it is not sanctified  or is it not that altar wherof the apostle speaks  lib we have an altar c if it be not that altar why doe they suffer dr pecklingtons christian altar so to passe under their authority which saith that this altar is necessary as without which no sacrifice we offer is sanctified and why doe they suffer other bookes that say the apostle meant this altar when he said we have an altar when therfore this synod calls in and damnes these bookes which by maintaining these altars of wood and stone doe overthrow and deny the onely altar iesus christ we may think that these men have some good meaning when they say that this situation of the holy table doth not imply that it is or ought to be esteemed a true and proper altar whereon christ is againe really sacrificed but it is and may be called an altar by us in that sence that the primitive church called it an altar now who knows how farre these men extend the primitive church perhaps down to innocent who first established transubstantiation now above foure hundred yeares agoe for as for the purest estate of the primitive church as in the apostles times the table of the lord was never called an altar at all properly or improperly the scripture calls it only the table of the lord and some hundred yeares after the apostles c  st  ans had no altars at all no not in name which the heathen did obiect unto them so as the primitive church in the purest time of it had not so much as the name of altars and our communion booke doth not once name it an altar how comes then this synod to be so bold as to call the table an altar and teach that it is and may be so called and what if some fathers called it so as they were a little too free though meaning no harme in their allegorising which the romanists have made advantage of to advance their idolatry and lord thou shalt try the spirit of these men whether for the love they beare to rome and to bring england to a perfect reconciliation with her they affect to call it an altar rather then a table though the time is not yet ripe for them fully to manifest themselves and to display their roman colours in open fields but for us we ought not in any sense to call the lords table an altar seeing the scripture calls it onely a table and never an altar and seeing also it is an easie inducement to popish idolatry and superstition to which use all papists use it and which use this synod by all signes shows it selfe easie to be intreated to bring up againe in the church of england for in the next place they make an order for rayling in this altar to seperate it from the rest of the church that none doe touch it as if it were more holy and the matter thereof more precious then any other part of the church and by this meanes though they pretend the prevention of profanation yet they labour to beget in the peoples minds some high and reverend opinion of this their altar as of some extraordinary holy creature or rather divine thing that so they may with the more facility and lesse se  up  e be brought to yeeld adoration therunto when ever they but look upon it or approach it or passe by it of which they tell us more anon and the next thing is that all that will receive the communion must come up to present themselves before this altar upon their knees condemning the usuall manner of the ministers carrying the bread and wine about the church but they called this altar a table but even now and is it so suddainly swallowed up in an altar as in stead of sitting about the table which is christs own ordinance and the proper use and posture of guests about a table now men must kneele before the altar as before some new godallmighty so as thine ordinance  lord is here quite perverted and from a tablecommunion turned into a superstitious altarservice whereas if the table were set in the midst and the communicants did come and sit round about it as many as could at a time and so did eat and drinke the lords supper this is christs own ordinance but to come and kneele before an altar this is not according to christs ordinance nor is it aright to eat the lords supper at the lords table the last tging is after many faire pretences and preambles as of the church the house of god dedicated to his holy worship to put us in mind of the greatnesse and goodnesse of his divine majesty and the like the synod thinks it very behoofull that all doe reverence and obeysance both at their coming in and going out of the churches chancels or chappels c and the motives which the synod useth to perswade all people hereunto are sundry as it is not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the communion table the east c or in the celebration of the holy eucharist as they call it rather the lords supper upon any opinion of a corporall presence of christs body there c now from these words though the synod doe not expressely and directly order that men in doing such reverence and obeysance do set their faces towards the altar eastward where it standeth yet we learne plainly their meaning to be so in that they say not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the communion table or east ergo towards the table or east men must doe reverence s  it be not with intention of religious worship but by their leaves intention or not intention so to bow so to doe reverence to or towards this or that place is no lesse then flat idolatry whether it be done to the place it selfe or thereby to god for god will not be worshiped in or by either an image or any representation of his majesty or divine presence as if god were fixed to this or that place all which is forbidden in the second commandement and being done to the creature as to the table or altar or towards the east being done in the church which they say is the place of gods worship must not all such externall worship there exhibited be a religious worship so as whether people intend any such thing or no as by doing obe  rsance to the table to exhibit religious worship yet the worship it selfe so exhibited in the place of gods worship is must needs be a religious yea and divine worship so as here is flat idolatry committed by authority of this holy synod or will they call this adoration for adoration it is a civil worship this is no lesse an absurdity and grosse profanation of things sacred to give them a civil worship therfore seeing the synod will needs have a worship so exhibited and this is not say they with any intention of a religious worship let them tell us what kind of worship they meane unlesse their meaning be this that it may passe for a religious worship as of the body so the intention of the mind be wanting that so a man may commit idolatry not yeelding a religious worship to the creature outwardly with his body so as his mind be free from intention that he meant no harme by it and the like reason there is for bowing or kneeling at the communion this is a religious worship or adoration and it is done as to some imaginary corporall presence of christ on the table or to the elements themselves or to the table but to be done as to christs corporall presence the sy  d would have that opinion forborne it remaines then that the adoration or religious worship to be done though not intended either to the elements or to the table or to the altar or to the east for now all the communicants are upon their knees all looking that way but say they secondly this worship is for the advancement of gods majesty and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him is it so and is it not then a religious worship that is so exhibited that is done for the advancement of gods majesty and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due un to him certainly this must needs be a religious and divine worship and that in a high degree and being so shall the synod be ashamed or affraid to allow men an intention of performing this religious worship when it is for the a  vancement of gods majesty will god accept of a sacrifice that wants a heart or how is god honoured by our service when it is done without an intention but here is yet a worse matter in it that marres the synods intention for the advancement of gods majesty and that is all this worship call it what they will is a meere willworship of which before and so of which god saithmath in vaine they honour and worship me teaching for doctrines the precepts of men and the synop cannot but confesse that all this courtceremony is the upshot of this their canon and constitution a commandement of men therefore and so abominable in gods worship and service but thirdly this say they to wit this outward reverence in gods worship must needs be pious in it selfe profitable unto us and edifying unto others must needs upon what necessity for first can that be pious in it selfe which god hath absolutely forbidden and condemned as abominable to be used in his service and such is all invention of man in gods worship as before secondly profitable to us say they wherein profitable to us to disobey and dishonour god in our fancifull devises or profitable in that sense wherein the pharisees taught children to cast off all honour to their parents saying unto them math it is a gift by whatso  ver thou mightest be profited by me and honour not his father or his mother so how can that benilutile quod non honestum est cic offic profitable to us which is dishonourable to our heavenly father and thirdly for edifying unto others how edifying surely no other way but as the apostle saith cor if any man see thee that hast knowledge sitting in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him that is weake dikodomethseta be edified as the word properly signifieth that is imboldened to eat of things offered to idols and just such edifying unto others is this willworship of the synod whereby they being men of knowledge and learning doe edify or imbolden simple people to follow their practise and obey their precept in giving reverence and obeysance in the church that is religious worship to a stone altar or wodden table which is idolatry though coloured over with never so specious and faire pretences as without any intention of a religious worship which is the ordinary apron of  igleaves wherewith the woman of rome would cover the nakednesse of such herr  spirituall fornications and filthinesse of her  bominations but fourthly this say they hath been the most ancient custome of the primitive church in the purest times and of this church also for many yeares of the raigne of queen elizabeth the reviving therfore of this ancient and laudable custome we heartily commend to the serious consideration of all good people how hath this been the most ancient custome of the primitive church in the purest times to common idolatry with stocks and stones for what were those purest times of the primitive church were they not the apostles owne times were not th  se the purest times of the primitive church and will they dare they say or much lesse can they prove that the apostles or the church in their time used any such custome fy for shame that a synod should dare without blushing to vent such abominable lyes for if they meane it of the times of the church after the apostles those certainly were not the purest times as wherein many supersitions began quickly to grow up to strow the way for the coming of antichrist the mystery of iniquity beginning to worke even in the apostles dayes but this devotion was of ancient custome in this church also for many yeares of the raigne of queen elizabeth thats true indeed i my selfe when i was a  ad have seen old women very observant in such obesances towards the e  st both coming in and going out of the church they would not misse it but ye must undestand this was a place where they had not scarce one sermon in seaven yeares so as it was no marvaile if still they walked in darknesse when they wanted the light to shine forth unto them in the preaching of the gospel which where it comes in the vigour of it drives away all darknesse of errour and spirituall blindnesse as thepsal sun arising chaseth the wild beasts into their dennes as david saith insomuch as we have seen and known by abundant experience blessed be our god that in all places of the kingdome where sound preaching hath been all such superstition hath been packed out of the church but this riddance could not be expected for some of the first yeares of queen elizabeth when the land was but newly crope out of popery and preachers were but scarce and the old race had not could not put away the old leaven or cast off the slough of popish superstition and therefore the synod saith truth in this that for some yeares yea in some places many of the raigne of queen elizabeth which was towards the beginning of her raigne these superstitious customes were in use and had the royall chappels and cathedralls had as sound preachers in them usually as other parochiall churches in the kingdome that would have ript up the rotten bowels of popish supersition so fairely painted over in goodly images crucifixes and the like unremoved in those places there had not by this time remained one romish ragge whereof this synod might make a coat for the church of england now to be fashioned by but now the coat is made up all the skill will be how to perswade this whole church to put it on yea it is so little and strait as being measured and patternd by two or three chappels and a few cathedralls it wilbe very hard to force it upon englands broad backe without extreme pinching of it or tearing the coat now for this in the last place this courteous and kind synod wheras it might command is pleased to stoop so low as to intreat yea heartily to intreat againe and againe we say they heartily commend this to all good and well affected people members of this church c and a little lower againe the reviving of this ancient and laudable custome we heartily commend to the serious c  nsideration of all good people and for this reason perswades us to beleeve that the synod is cordiall in redubbling such hearty commendations of such romish reliques and so laudable customes to all good people first because good people will not easily be drawn to such things without some strong motive nor with that neither and secondly could their hearty commendations prevaile in this it would greatly conduce to a speedy making up of that reconciliation between the church of england and of rome so greatly desired and laboured in the primates late relation the president of this synod who tells us there more plainly what we may understand here by commending for saith he pag there is a laudendo praecipere by lauding or commending  command and therefore they stick not to be so liberall in their hearty commendations of this brave piece of service but why should now this spirit be conjured up againe or this dead coale of romish zeale revived having for so long a time lyen consopited yea dead under a heap of ashes never to have kindled flames or troubled the world againe why should this satan of our peace which had been so long bound now be let loose againe to set kingdomes in a combustion  surely they told us before uniform  ty is to be desired how  in a conformity to the royall chappels and cathedrals but were it not every way better that those few should give place and rather conforme to the generality of all the churches in england where these superstitions had been cast out and all quiet then that the generality should conform to a few to indanger the whole state and hazzard the losse of all  but in the last place they come with a pretty handsome close saying in the practise or omission of this rite we desire that the rule of charity prescribed by the apostle may be observed which is that they which use this rite despise not them who use it not and that they who use it not condemne not those that use it o lord god ps  l how long shall the wicked blaspheme thy name for ever can they not be content to abuse thy people in leading and drawing them into all manner of superstition but they must usurpe the apostles rule and pervert it to the maintenance of such blind and damned rites the rule of the apostle is for the use of things in their own nature indifferent as eating or not eating wherein charity is to preserve peace but it gives no countenance at all to things altogether unlawfull in themselves and no way indifferent as before and had these men true charity they would be so farre from pressing these things to a generall use as they would rather altogether suppresse them where they are used as being a stumbling blocke to the whole land upon the which if not removed the whole land must stumble and fall and therefore had this synod had any one sparke of an apostolicall spirit in it as they show it to be altogether apostaticall it would in the first place have rather observed the apostles rule for a man not to put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way then breaking this rule of charity have abused the apostles words to prescribe to a whole land a rule of false charity but to thee o lord doe we commit the judgement of this whole cause which we can doe no more nor lesse but complain of to thy majasty the righteous judge of all the world canon of preaching for conformity this synod here for the more strenthening of their canons and the more facilitating of the way to conformity thereunto must injo  ne their priests whom they have in their chaine fast bound by subscription by oath of canonicall obedience and by oath of this synod to the observation of the decrees thereof and other their lordships commands to preach for conformity and inspeciall for conformity to the canon immediately forefoing which this canon immediately succeeds as pointing them to that before as followeth in the canon the tenour whereof is whereas the preaching of order and decencie according to s pauls rule doth conduce to edification it is required that all preachers as well beneficed men as others shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the people in their publicke sermons twice in the yeare at  page  page soules from the yoake of such vile slavery unlesse you have so much courage in you as to deny to doe these base  d  udgerres for these your t  kemasters though you be suspended for it and loose all you have strengthen  lord all th  e to stand fast in thy truth and not to betray it with them  their people and the whole state of the land now passing by the th th th th canons as of  moment in the th of excommunication and absolution not to be pronounced but by a priest herein first we may observe what kind of excommunications and absolutions have been usuall in our prelates  extreme abusie and prefanation of christs ordinance  of his church which ordinance as it doth  belong to the prelate whose whole order   eere usurpation so it is most basely abused  and their officers so as here is a reformat  at the best is stark nought as being an  usurpation for in this canon they take away all power from every  of his congregation to whom with others appointed by the parish according to gods word belongs the power of ecclesias  call censures and in this canon also he that is absolved must become more bound then ever he was before because first he must take an oath de parendo juri stando mandatis beclesiae of obeying the canons and standing to the commands of the church so as his absolution becomes his bondage when now in stead of gods commandements he must be subject to the churches canons decrees and commands which is an antichristian tyranny and more now then ever before for this synod sake againe omitting the th and th canon the th is concerning licenses to marry so as this canon is to maintaine a doctrine of devils mentioned by the apostle as namely forbidding to marry be it either to some sort of men as romish priests or to all sorts of men at certaine times in the yeare  as at such times which altogether containe almost halfe of the yeare without the bishops speciall licence no man or woman may marry thus it is cleare that herein these hypo  rites the sell gods free ordinance for money and so maintaine a doctrine of devils and thus farre of the canons of this synod the conclusion of all which is the kings avowing approving confirming and injoyning these canons to be observed of all respectively according to the tenure thereof in all and every part hereof we will say no more then we have sayd in the begining of our complaint committing all judgement unto thee  righ  iudge of all and  beseeching thee withall that  wilt judge the cause of thy people when now thou seest  their strength is gone and to take them and their and thy cause into thy holy protection to vindicate both them and it  thy own glorious name from the cruelty and reproch o  men amen here now follow some predictions of and some contradidictions unto this late synod observed and collected out of the relation of a conference by william of canterbury prediction f  in his epi  dedicatory to the king he saith the king and the priest more then any other are bound to look to the integrity of the church in doctrine and manners and that in the first place for thats by farre the best hone in the hive this we see now fullfilled whereby we come to know who is that priest and what that integity of the church in doctrine and manners concluded in this late synod but whether as in a hive of bees or in a  or hornets nest as wherewith whole kingdomes  the world judge prediction and againe ibid to deale clearely with your majesty these thoughts of the externall worship of god are they and no other which  make me labour so much as i have done for d  cen  y and an  of the externall worship of god in the church thus we see that the whole plot and project of the primates booke was thus to alter and thus to settle the doctrine and discipline and external worship in the church as we have seen effected in the late synod so as it appeares both this synod and the things concluded therein have been a good w  ile a hammering is  forge prediction and in the relation it selfe pag to the  to wit the prince and the clergie principally the power and direction for reformation belongs princes have their parts by their calling together of the bishops and others of the clergie to consider of that which might seem worthy reformation and the clergie did their part in the nationall synod of and the articles there agreed on were afterwards  firmed by acts of state and the royall assent here is another patterne of this late nationall synod but that this wants the right legge to make it goe upright and passe currant for a nationall synod namely the confirmation by the act of state to wit the act of parliament  as before is noted so as here is also one contradiction overthrowing this nationall synod consisting of the two provinciall canterbury and yorke both together want the act of parliament to confirme it a nationall synod to bind the whole nation which the synod presumes to doe both in ministers and people contradiction relat emperours and kings are custodes utriusque tabalae they to whom the  and preservation of both tables of the law for worship to god and duty to man are committed a booke of the law was by gods owne command in moses his time was to be given to the king deut the kings under the law but still according to it did proceed to necessary reformations in church businesses and theirin commanded the very priests themselves c this being so that the kings under the law had the care of the preservation of gods law and religion committed unto them to preserve them safe and sound and where any corruption had crept in to reform religion but still according to gods law and that not one jot to vary from it how comes this synod of priests being assembled by royall authority and commanded by a king under the gospel to treat and agree upon some canons necessary for the advancement of gods glory the edifying of his holy church and the due reverence of his blessed mysteries and sacraments to be so bold as to agree and conclude and enact such canons and constitutions as are directly against the law and word of god to the great dishonour of god the ruinating of his holy church and the great abuse and profanation of his blessed mysteries and sacraments and herein we call heaven and earth to witnesse and the lord iesus christ to be judge whether this synod hath dealt faithfully or no with the king or between him and his people and that also in these perillous times the lord open the kings eyes to see how both himselfe and his people are abused and his kingdomes embroyled and indangered by these his prelates and priests that synods may erre and foulely too this of proves with a  if any canons of it be sound the sixth hath poyson enough to infect them all its such a cockatrice egge as was ne  layd in england before  that eateth of a dyeth i will here a little  bowell this oath and shew you the mischief in it this oath is contrary to the title of it which is an  injoynd for the preventing of all innovations in doctrine and government being a grand innovation such as neither we nor our forefathers ever heard of besides it hath in the body of it an et  era an expression yet unknown to the christian  pagan world archbishop arundell judge provided better for the clergy in his dayes in that ancient constitution  sub obtestatione divini judi  j inhibemus sp  cial   cu  uscunque gradus status aut condition  existat   usiones aut proposi  de  ide catholica aut ben  s  sonantes praeter necessarium doctrina  facultatis suae in scholis  extra disputando aut communicando protestat  e per  ss   permissa asperat  quodam verborum vel  er  rum  teste b hugone de sacrum saepiu  quod bene dicitur non bene intelligit  r if harsh and novel expressions may not be used in familiar discourse much lesse may they be crowded into an oath the israelites said of the levites concubine there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out the land of aegypt unto this day consider of it take advise and speake that same may be said of this oath there was never such a deed done or seen since we came out of spirituall aegypt consider of it take advise and speake what shall be done to these innovators its against the king and his prerogative royall who by the statutes and customes of this kingdome hath power to appoint any of his naturall subjects to exercise all manner of ecclesiasticall jurisdiction under him as appeareth by stat elizab cap and stat hen cap and hen cap but this oath spoyles his majesty of all such power investing onely archbishops bishops deanes c with ecclesiasticall power and so takes from his majesty what his predecessor henry the had who gave a commission to lord cro  d to  cise under him all jurisdiction ecclesiasticall as you may  in mr fox his martyrologie volume pa printed an its against the oath of supremacy in taking of which we acknowledge the kings majesty to be supreme governour of the church in all causes and over all persons ecclesiasticall as well as civil and the king by law having power to alter church government and to delegate whom he pleaseth of his subjects to exercise ecclesiasticall jurisdiction as appeares by what is foresaid and still is in practise in the high comission in which are alwayes the lords of his majesties privy  if the oath be once lawfully taken what new power can discharge it in such a case they may aswell unchristian me as unsweare me how can any honest sworne subject take this new oath without manifest danger and great suspition of per  ary for having sworne before for the king in case he alter the government by vertue of this oath i have sworne against the king set up oath against oath myselfe against my soveraigne and that which is yet worse must not repent of it for i am sworne from ever consenting to what his majesty hath done and is that all no i must dissent and become a schismatick and seperatist for ever neither is that all but i must take up armes twice a year at least and preach for the hierarchie and their present government against my soveraigne and that he hath charged this i am bound to by vertue of the  canon and if not by the oath of canonicall obedience and in case a minister refuse or neglect this its suspension by his  and if it be done who knows but it may c  st hang  tuum for resisting supreme authority againe this oath is a plot to sweare in the conceit of epis  pacie to be jure divino of late they have stepd off from their ancient foundation thinking to weaknesse either to depend vpon humane laws or princes favours and have published to the whole world that their standing is by divine right and therfore  page  lib dis  in  t act now this oath will hinder the alteration of the church government to a better for being once sworn to melius non mutabis pejus christs kingdome must be kept out antichristian offices government rules and wayes of proceeding be established in the church and that by an oath if the book of common prayer would better the discipline and doe much wish therefore to have publique penance restored this oath contradicts it and tells us that we have all the discipline is needfull to salvation and that the government by right ought to stand a  now it stands but there are great grievances dreadfull disorders and horrible corruptions in the discipline and government of the church as now it stands and men should rather sweare to indeavour their utmost to get them removed in this approaching parliament then give consent to have them unalterd one day longer as iesuworship altarworship kneeling at sacrament promiscuous receivers subscription oaths ex officio canonicall obedience reading of apocrypha books abuse of excommunication the exorbitant power of bishop interdicting whole churches perverting equity in all their courts changing times and seasons for marriage at their pleasure hindring preaching and praying where they list imposing new and unlawfull things upon the ministry illegally outing them from their livings c the proceeding yet in many things by the popes canon law the taking away the power of the keyes from the pastors of particular congregations and setting up chancellors over them and their flocks putting into laymens hands for a chancellor is no other the power of excommunication layelders are much cryed out of and condemnd by us in the scottish and forraigne churches and yet we set and hold them up at home with both hands the bishop delegates his power to the chancellour and so the sentence of excommunication is devolvd upon a meere layman which dealing with presbyterians we say is incompatible to a layman and what is this but to destroy with the hand what we bind with the tongue neither is that shift avayleable to say its some grave minister that must pronounce the sentence because he is but os canceliarij the mouth of the chancellour to pronounce what he decrees who can stoppe it if not pronouncd call it out of the ministers hand and must give the a  solution if pronounced and so the whole power lyes still in the chancellors hand if these things therefore and diverse other were altered we should not abjure them but thinke our selves bound by right and conscience to intertaine them againe this oath appeares further to be unlawfull first because it doth insuare our consciences and takes away the liberty of them binding us not so much as to consent unto any alteration although it should be in the judgement of all farre better then what we have secondly it doth make us vassals and bondslaves to the prelary we must be their sworn subjects and tye our selvs by oath to uphold their tottering kingdome and if the prelacie have its pedegree from rome as some of themselves  me what is this oath but a policie to setch in our shoulders so support antichrist and his government what is it but the plain marke of the beast which some make to be an oath and others a submitting to his power and acknowledging of him to be lord me  d in comment  here is both an oath and an absolute  unto the  and acknowledging of them to be  by this oath free  become  which  contrary to the petit  on of right  it is an  and perpetuating of humane and  for the whole hierarchie mentiond in the oath from archbishops to the end of the c are sufficiently known to be moore ecclesiasticall constitutions and subject to such coruptions from time to time as may necessitate an altert  ion are there not such  oule corruptions now amongst them as er  mightily to the parliament for alteration and without redresse will sinke the whole kingdome what safety or  then hath any man to sweare these constitutions into an in  rable condition its a condem  g of all other reformed churches they have not our discipline and yet we have given them the right hand of fellowship that they want nothing necessary to salvation and if we sweare this discipline to be necessary to salvat  we must condemne them as wanting somthing necessary thereunte its little lesse then to unchurch and to pronounce them to be without that discipline which is essentiall to the beeing of a true church and they may charge us with falsifying the th and  a  ch which teach that things belonging to government and dis  ipline are alterable and so much is expressed in the title of ceremonies before the book of common prayer because by this oath the prelates are invested with a  which neither god nor the laws of the kingdome ever gave them as namely upon refusall of this wretched oath they will deprive any painfull conscientious and faithfull minister of all his ecclesias  call promotions whatsoever and of the execution of his function which is directly against law for if pastors be legally possessd of their hvings what injustice is it to make aftercanons and oaths to question and throw them out of their right this synod had not our consents and suffrages for the clerks of it those were legally chosen had voyce no longer in the convocation house then the parliament indured there being therfore no new el  ction of clerks nor any new writ to legitimate those but onely a new commission to goe on with what was begun in parliament but nul  by breach thereof  being  out that commission the space of a whole weeke as  by the date thereof may  we cannot but j  dge both oath and canons to be illegall the oath implyes a plain contradiction and that which is  it requires me to sweare sincerely without any secret reservation and  an c in it which imports more then is expre  and necessi  aces a mentall conception and  we are bound to take it heartily and willingly which no man that hath any consideration or conscience can doe for its against truth and obligeth to sweare a falsehood viz that the government of this church as now it stands ought by right so to stand which is not true of chancellours commissaries off  alls c nor of bishops proceeding in their courts in their own names and under their own seales it s against judgement including a contradiction as appeares in the th particular its against righteousnes because both the parliament the prince and pastors themselves are perjured by it as hath formerly bin shewn and its a swearing up a corrupt if not an antichristian government over the people besides this oath is backed with severe punishment refusall of it brings deprivation ab officio beneficio hence many that are poore and weake its to be feared will take the oath reluctante conscientia and to save their livings forsweare themselves this oath is full of ambiguities the doctrine of the church is not clearely known the homilies have been disclaimd the articles are challenged by the armi  ans and others to be for them its doubtfull to us whether a great part of scripture be not excluded as unnecessary because much of the scripture is neither verbaily expressed nor vertually included in the publique declaration of the doctrine and discipline of the church of england and that they are said to containe all things necessary to salvation we are doubtfull of the discipline because much depends upon the interpretation of the ordinary which is unknown and yearely differing articles are composed for visitations and although a generall standing book of articles be promised for the whole kingdome yet three yeares liberty is reserved for alteration and who can say he knoweth what the discipline is we doubt whether the oath doth not suppose some popish doctrine established we know not in what sense those words by right it ought to stand are to be taken this word jus or right is a word equivocall there is jus divinum and if we sweare in this sense then we sweare deanes archdeac  s and the c to stand jure divino there is jus ecclesiasticum and if we sweare in that sense then the prelates will not be our friends because we sweare divine right from them there is jus positum and if we sweare in this sense then the hierarchie must loose both divine and ecclesiasticall right it being thus who can sweare without equivocation lastly no man taking this oath can well acquit himselfe of perjury for if he take it in the plain common sense and understanding of the words yet there must be some mentall reservation in the words c and equivocation in the minds of hyerarchicall men touching those words by right for though they should venture to sweare prelates into a jus divinum yet they dare not sweare deanes and archdeacons into it and so must sweare in a double sense and perjure themselves but all this may be helped by our own interpretations and protestations perjurisunt quiid quod falsum esse sciunt aut putant juramento confirment est in sent  dist ans we may not take it in our own senses those authorized to administer the oath by the kings commission are tyed to keep the very words of it if they should leave out the c they have no power to administer it at all and the oath it selfe binds us to take it in the common sense of the words if we then take the oath and protest against such and such senses and make a sense of our own this is direct and wilfull perjury said civilians and the protestation being made before a publique notary this shalbe sufficient evidence in any cou  t of the kingdome to convict us of the perjury if then any of the prelater have taken this oath in its proper sense or a sense of their own how have they perjurd themselvs prophamd their hands and put in a barre against their future conferring of holy orders qui  synodus nod   patrum chorus integer

vnwittingly and therefore guilty of the crueltie so grieuous were his groanes and lamentation they turne to sorrow all his habitation and though his sonnes and daughters all arise to comfort him the

or if it bee he may whilst he from cruell beasts did flie forsake his coate to scape more speedily he that this coate found loose vpon the ground not any signe of murthering him found nor found he either hand head foot or bone onely this bloody coate lay all alone blooded it seemes with iawes of cruell beast which on some other prey had made his feast "thus can the whole to sicke good counsell giue "and easier tis to teach well then to liue but ruben iudah all his sonnes may rise and daughters all to comfort him deuise he rends his clothes puts sacke cloth on his loines and for his ioseph long time weepes and pines and mourning will goe downe vnto his graue to ioseph whom he here shall neuer haue meane while to nile the midian merchants hie laden with balme with mirrhe and spicerie

them bost of such antiquitie and reckon in their annuall computation thousands of yeares before the vvorlds creation but though he gaue them in all arts direction yet neuer brought they one to such perfection as that we call diuine astronomie for in this country best they might descrie the formes and orders of the lamps of night vvhere neuer clouds obscure them from their sight first in caldea abram learnd this skill and grew so well acquainted with gods will he knew all things they say by reuelation past present future from the vvorlds creation till that last minute that it could expire vvhich as by water erst shall be by fire indeed saith ioseph i haue heard it tould the first man adam prophecide of ould the worlds destruction twice for sinnes iust hire the one by water thother by

which long experience had obserued he vnto future ages faire preserued the earthen pillar perisht in the flood the stone the waters violence withstood these heber finding after published in syria where first learning flourished till abram who herein did all excell came downe to egypt and as you doe tell conuerst with one they called mercury whom with these arts he taught the mystery of one trine godhead and the worlds creation who read the same vnto their neighbour nation whence now they are and shall in time be spred through all the earthly globe inhabited thus they discourse as if they would foretell of gentiles all which after should excell in arts and sciences which now dispread as men through all the earth on which we tread for as the earth empeopled was below by adam so all arts and learning flow first from the hebrews vnto eury nation as rules and precepts come by obseruation but now the citties towres obscure the skies and make them hold their tongues and vse their eyes the splendor of those buildings to behold where they the second time good ioseph sold the end of the first booke of ioseph the second booke of ioseph neuer did adam more lament and plaine for

his body wearied with groanes and tossing vp and downe his bed loe aged isaack who had long beene blinde ofs fleshly eyes but yet of clearer minde comes to his comfort being thither led by beniamin who to him ministred long stood he mute and to the grieuous moanes of his blist iacob ecchoed with groanes tills heart with sorrow ready now to breake with words all weight he thus begins to speake

vvhich hardlier here obtaind we hold more deare thus isaac doth interpret visions darke as great mathuselah at building tharke vvho liud vntill the yeare of th inundation as plaine appeares by ages computation good israel was wonderfully moud at sight of those he reuerencd so and loud his beniamin but newly taught to stride of his blinde grandsires steppes then being guide both which seemd two good angels to him sent from heaun to ease his griefe and discontent vvherefore soone rising on his wearie bed hauing his father duly honoured he answers with a piteous sigh and grone ioseph is gone and i am left alone deare rachels first borne whom to make my wife i was a seruant best part of my life after we had beene maryed foureteene yeares rachel and i with prayers vowes and teares beggd him of god then did my yeares expire vvhich laban for my two wiues me did hire one daughter and tenne sonnes i had before by leah seun and by my handmaids foure but i my ioseph prizd them all aboue as i his mother more then theirs did loue and though i churlish did mine vncle finde in many things herein he was most kinde to pay me wages ere my worke was done for i had rachel ere that i begun my first yeares seruice whereby seun yeares seemd but a few daies so i her loue esteemd no man had euer more experience then i of gods good grace and prouidence vvhen i was first to padan aram sent i only with my staffe forth from thee went to bethel where thalmightie lord to mee appeard by vision promising to bee my god and to my seede the land to giue whereon i slept which firmely i beleeue then did i vow so he would me protect safe in my iourney and my wayes direct giuing me bread to eate and clothes to weare the tenth of all i had to offer there god gaue my asking and abundance more so as i thence returnd with stocke and store and though i long forbare my vow to pay god neuer me forgot vnto this day i confident beyond all hope can proue i him shall see againe whom so i loue at the last day till then hees dead and gone no hope before of resurrection this is his colourd coat begored red by iawes of beasts which on his carkasse fed were i now blinde i happy were then could i not this dismall spectacle behold but if saith isaack he hath changd his tent for heaunly home why should you thus lament as without hope since now he is at rest let likewise the remembrance of him rest weepe you because your losse turnes to his gaine your mourning cannot bring him back againe god our chiefe comforts oft from vs doth rend lest we too much on outward meanes depend it may be you your loue so on him set you thereby did your loue to god forget thens iustice iustly him from you hath rent and mercy giues you cause now to repent but whether ioseph liuing be or dead let little beniamin stand in his stead what your affection so to him enclind you eun the same in beniamin shall find of rachel both begot in marriage bed only this last she neuer suckeled for in the paines of birth she left her life thus he a tender nurse lost thou a wife this isaacks rubbing on an ancient sore made israel lament more then before so as the childe who still was standing by to heare such mourning weepes for company and as a parret newly taught to prate the voice doth of another imitate so cryes the boy good father iosephs gone and i alas here left am all alone tis this fine colourd coat he wont to weare good father let vs it to ioseph beare for that was euer vnder iacobs arme he may haue neede thereof to keepe him warme these pleasant reasons from the witty child old iacob of his sorrowes so beguild he was content a while his heart to ease the better this his dearest boy to please and since he ioseph thought dead and at rest by little he his lamentations ceast but euer little beniamin would cry to let him goe to ioseph by and by my boy saith iacob if that thou wilt goe to ioseph thou must first as ioseph doe be a good boy serue god thy prayers say at morne at night and oftentimes a day all lying swearing idle talke forbeare duly obey and serue thy parents deare to any nor of any speake least ill and alwaies be obedient to gods will for so did ioseph therefore i had giun him this fine colourd coat but now in heaun he is most gloriously by god arraid and sees all ioyes and pleasures can be said by this the boy to imitate growes faine ioseph in all for hope of iosephs gaine if iacob any thing would haue him doe say ioseph did it he would doe it too if he from any ill would him retaine say ioseph would not dot he would refraine all which he so well ordered that in fine the boy was measurd all by iosephs line and iacob so delighted therewithall he leaues his couch and comes downe to the hall where euer beniamin his darling deare was ready with his pratling him to cheare till in the end his loue so on him set makes him all griefe for iosephs losse forget and pleasure take in beniamin now more then he in ioseph euer did before so doth one for his wife oft weepe and crie as after her he would not liue but die forbeares his meat till time of mourning past then cheares his spirits and fals to his repast and suddenly a second mariage proues whome he more dearely then the former loues and so his deare affection on her sets he all his former sorrowes quite forgets thus liud old iacob many happy yeares with beniamin but wisely he forbeares him to aduenture once out of his sight lest as good ioseph him befall it might twelue times through all the signes the sunne had past and now through gemini was making hast when he more kindly on his paramore the earth did shine then euer heretofore which made the superstitious cananite adore this planet as a god of might and by religion of his owne deuising to worship the sunnesetting well as rising and amongst other their inuentions vaine dan phoebus to leaue delos ile they faine to court the nimph of iordane for his bride and her to honour with his fertile side therefore her bankes he richly doth adorne and hills and valleyes fills so thicke with corne the eared lands seeme a continued plaine vvhose eares of corne stoope to the ground againe and she proud of the honour of his rayes her bosome all with fragrant flowres begayes the more him with sweet sauours to delight and seeme more faire embellisht in his sight vvhich made the hills and dales to laugh and sing and all the birds with sweetest warbeling vvith them to tune sweet ditties to his praise vvhose heat and light diuides the night from daies seun times this gyant his full course had run and ended where his trauell he begun vvhilst iordans nimph continues in his grace vvhich canaan made the happyest fruitfull place of all the regions where sunnes fertile heate doth cause the laborer with ioy to sweate but as we alwaies after drowth see raine warre after peace and after pleasure paine so after plenteous and fruitfull yeares great famine want and scarcitie appeares in canaans land for seun yeares being past of plenty famine all the world doth wast therefore they that of late sols mariage faind now of his wrath and iealousie complaind that he which with his beames late cherished all fruits the earth in fruitfull bosome bred was so inflamd with iealousie and ire as if he all the earth would set on fire so as he either would her seedes not daigne to quicken or if that the hopefull graine promisd a fruitfull haruest at the last he in his fury all would burne or blast thus did those heathen of gods wonders fable and vainly construe his workes admirable but good old israel who like lillywhite amongst the thornes feard god and did vpright the glory they did to the creature giue gaue the creator who doth euer liue and looking to the author of this store for this his greater plenty honours more and takes the famine for a chastisement to man for sinne that so he might repent but as the plenteous store did nothing breede but pride and follies vaine in canaans seede excessiue rioting lust drunkennesse amongst the rich nicenesse and idlenesse amongst the poore who swinishly eun all the acornes eate but looke not whence they fall consuming all the corne their land them beares not laying vp least store for dearer yeares but loathing and despising courser graine transport it as superfluous for their gaine so when the earth denide like store to bring all fall to grudging and to murmuring and sol whom they so honourd at the first for his high fauours for his fury curst and those which late so plenteously were fed in the first yeare are like to sterue for bread yea holy iacob though he were exempt from canaans sinnes yet in their punishment doth beare his share and now for want of bread he feares the ruine of himselfe and seede and though he sole relyeth on gods grace of which he had good tryall in like case neglects no meanes to make supply of store but thus bespeakes his sonnes i heretofore when plenty in your fields did so abound wisht that a man amongst you might be found who wisely would for future wants prouide but folly tis for had i wist to chide we heare thers store of corne in egypt land yet one doth gaping on another stand oh hast you thither bread from thence to buy to saue aliue vs and our family the brethren ten for iacob would not send downe beniamin with them do soone descend to egypt where neare memphis on the way a graue old sage they ouertake in gray who seemd by his graue gestures and his motions to be a hermit now at his deuotions as isaacke going out one eun to pray seeing his seruant lighting on the way with faire rebecca vaild and all her traine left his deuotions them to entertaine eun so this sage whose eyes on heauen were plast as they would thither ere his body hast seeing these gentle strangers there alight and him to mutuall courtesie inuite leaues his deuotions and of them enquires knowing they hebrewes were by their attires in their owne language what and whence they are which true and plainly they to him declare and farther tell him that a famine sore had now consumd their corne and all their store compelling them from canaan to goe downe to egypt where they knew none nor were knowne therefore saith ruben may we you request vs strangers to informe as you may best of your condition first next of your king your countrey and your forme of gouerning and if as fame reports heres store of graine and how and where we may the same obtaine for here eun as at home we see all wast no future haruest nor least signe of past and therefore with my brethren i desire to know the cause of what we so admire without a seedtime or a haruest plentie and garners full although the fields be emptie brethren said trismegist for so he hight i first must here lay open to your sight that beings his goodnesse power and prouidence by which we all haue motion being sense who the first cause of all doth things dispose by second these we see that keepes he close i am a priests and princes eldest sonne for priests and princes are in egypt one and to the sunne as was our countrey guize was consecrate to offer sacrifice great trismegistus was mine ancester a king a priest and a philosopher soone as my tongue mens words could imitate and though with little vnderstanding prate my parents me instruct to learne by heart the rules of wisedome and the lawes of art the aspects of the starres their seuerall wayes coniunctions orders interposings stayes flying of birds beasts intrailes and in fine all that might make with them a sound diuine and well i profited for ere least haire of siluer with my golden did appeare the wisest i of all my peeres was deemd and most in temple and in court esteemd could best of all expound the hardest theames tell men their fortunes and interpret dreames thus i the oracle was many a yeare of egypt and of all the countries neare till that high wisdome which things future knowes as present them by dreames to pharoh showes fast by a riuer side him thought he stood whence came vp seun fat kine well flesht and good and other seun illfauourd leane that houre came vp and all the faire ones did deuoure againe he slept and saw seun eares of corne on one root wellset ranke and goodly borne which seuen thin blasted spoild and eate vp cleane then pharoh wakd and lo it was a dreame the morning come and he sore troubeled his sonthsayers are all assembeled pharoh thereof to vs makes declaration but not a man can giue thinterpretation our spheres spels circles birdes nor sorceries had power to discerne these mysteries then pharoh moud and thenceforth grieuing sore forbeares his meate and comes abroad no more vntill his butler raisd againe to grace who had forgot his friend in wretched case till twice twelue times the moon with borrowed light had filld her hornes for friends once out of sight are eun as soone out of a courtiers minde "such curtesie in court most schollers finde thus said to pharoh sir you cannot yet chuse but remember how you did commit me and your baker to your stewards ward for some misdeeds which you of vs had heard where in the prison we a young man found in whom diuinest wisedome did abound for we a seuerall dreame had in a night which told to him to vs he read aright the baker to the gallowes i to grace should be restord and all in three dayes space this of our dreames thinterpretation was all which you saw most truely came to passe thus ends the butler pharaoh glad to heare of ought might ease his longing wishd him there who quickly sent for shaud appareld white as him became to stand in pharohs sight heard and as soone his dreame did right expound which by nine yeares experience true is found for these seaun faire kine and ranke goodly eares he did interpret seun fat fruitfull yeares the seun thin sterued which did them deuower seun yeares of famine  in a lucky hower for egypt for thus store we vp did lay in fruitfull yeares against this euill day and not sole happy for our temporall store but spirituall for many who before long led in ignorance and errour blind till they gods truth by good experience find to stones and stockes sunne moone and starres did fall now worship god the maker of vs all of which for euer blessed be his name a thankfull one i though thvnworthiest am and hauing all vaine worldly ioyes forsaken now to deuotion sole my selfe betaken thus ends the sage when iudah holy sire hearing thy words gods goodnesse we admire happy that god hath kindled in thy breast the holy fire these flames doe manifest but tell vs what became of that great sage which of such store and famine did presage you told vs how the butler him neglected but how hath pharoh his desert respected for great ones for the most part doe despise the poore though they be nere so iust and wise and though the land is by their wisedomes guarded they are not long respected or rewarded thats thend saith trismegist for which i told the rest when as king pharoh did behold such heaunly wisedome in such youthfull yeares for scarce six lustres in his face appeares who counselld him with speede for to prouide a man of vnderstanding that might guide his vnder officers through all the land to store vp plenty vnder pharohs hand the fifth part eun of all their corne and seede to feede his people in the time of neede the saying seemd so good in pharohs eyes and all his seruants that they soone deuise because no man in egypt could be found in whom the spirit of god did so abound to place him ouer all his house and land that all might be eun as he should command thus now he with the king is all as one he only sits aboue him in his throne him then most sumptuously apparelling he made the lord and keeper of his ring the which he vsed as the publique seale for all his priuate state and commonweale and his second charet brauely placd and with the highest princely honour gracd this is the man hath stord vp in the land great heapes of corne in number like the sand for as the sands cannot be numbered no more the plenty he hath gathered now twice the sunne hath his full course nigh past since all our lands haue barren lien and wast nilus no more our fields hath watered nor fertile dewes our fruits haue cherished and now the dearth in all the land is sore as well amongst the richest as the poore the garners opend are and thence is sold great store of corne nor doth this prince withhold from strangers his prouision for wellny all regions hether come them corne to buy this man will you for money corne afford for hes wise gentle iust and feares the lord but whilst the sage to them this tale relates they vnawares approach neere memphis gates then to his cell returnes the aged sire they hast into the citie to enquire more of that prince by whom the corne was sold where they their brother though vnknowne behold the end of the second booke of ioseph the third booke of ioseph now is the time that all the sheaues must bend to one now raisd on high vpon his end the sunne moone starres eleuen must now to him they meanely erst accounted bow for ioseph now by due desert and right is placd in honours chariot shining bright and all the corne the treasure of the land vnder his sole disposing and command for this same ioseph which the hebrewes sold is he of whom great trismegist erst told who corne had heapd vp numberlesse like sand and was the ruler ouer egypts land when lo the brethren tenne before him brought low bowing to the ground him thus besought great lord whose wisdome and deserued grace giues thee in egypt eun the second place whose prudence honour glory and renowne through all the habitable earth is knowne vouchsafe to vs thy seruants now such grace as thou hast done to many in our case we brethren all one mans sonnes come to buy corne to releeue vs and our family except we by thy clemencie be fedde we and our race must die for want of bread the lord of egypt then who them did know but was vnknown himself strange rough doth show and now remembring well his dreames of late for which these that thus honour him did hate thus answers see you haue a faire pretence to buy you corne and victuall from hence but you are come into the land as spies to see wherein our strength and weakenesse lies ist like ten brethren should so farre descend none left at home their houses to defend or are you all without a house or home and masterlesse about the countrie rome truly saith iudah we twelue brethren bee all one mans sonnes of which thou ten dost see the least at home doth with his father stay but no man knowes where thother is this day to buy foode are thy seruants hither come for vs and for our families at home by this saith then the prince the truth ile know whether you as i say be spyes or no for by the life of pharoh no man home shall goe before your younger brother come take them to prison till his comming tryes the truth by pharohs life you are but spyes then he three dayes committeth them to ward whilst of an answer they themselues prepard thus as gods minister and substitute he vengeance on their sinnes doth retribute sinnes now forgot because so long since past but though gods slow he payes them home at last yea then when they themselues thinke most secure for iosephs wrongs he pays them home and sure happy who make right vse of chastisement which is to hate forsake sinne and repent but they in prison ioseph doth aduise alone with god how he may best deuise them for their foule offences to correct and yet his aged father not neglect whom faine he would releeue with store of graine but feares his brethren will not come againe the third day therefore thus saith ioseph heare doe this and liue for i the lord doe feare if you be true men as you all affirme leaue one man bound the rest all home returne with corne for to releeue your family then bring your brother and not one shall dye but traffique here as true men in the land and i will free your hostage from his band his word preuaild but they in conscience prickt for their cruelty and foule offence long since committed gainst this lord vnknowne and thinking god now payes them with their owne thus one to other to complaine begin ah how did we against our brother sinne when his soules anguish did to vs appeare and he besought vs yet we would not heare therefore on vs this trouble now doth fall when ruben thus oh did i not you all not to offend against the lad desire and now you see god doth his bloud require little thinke they that ioseph by doth stand and all their speeches plainly vnderstand who turnes and weepes yet soone returnes againe so friends afflictions teares from friends constraine then taking simeon he him binds with bands before their eyes and secretly commands to fill their sackes with prouender and graine and put their money in their sackes againe so they returne with conscience tiring more then all the miles from nile to iordanes shore as when tenne horse men rouing out for prey lose one of their deare fellowes by the way though with rich spoiles they to the campe returne all for him lost lift vp their voice and mourne so mourne these brethren nine for simeons chaine their brothers losse was greater then their gaine but when gad in the inne his sacke vnbindes for prouender and there his money findes their hearts them failing all are sore affraid that they as simeon likewise were betraid ah what say they hath god vpon vs brought for all the wickednesse which we haue wrought this thing vpon vs all is iustly come but most especially on simeon who was the cruellest and rather would haue ioseph slaine then to the merchants sold but when at home they to their father tell all that to them in egypt had befell and how that they for spyes were taken there imprisoned three dayes and put in feare and that the man there still kept simeon bound till by inquirie all the truth he found and seeing also eury man bring backe the money which he carryed in his sacke the good old man was wondrously affraid that simeon eun as ioseph was betraide and said my sonnes you laugh mine age to scorne you haue my simeon pawnd or sold for corne else where should you prouide such store of graine and yet bring all your moneys home againe but when they farther told him in a word how rough and sterne they found th egyptian lord and that their bringing beniamin must trye whether or no they came the land to spy he thinkes they likewise seeke him to depriue of beniamin his dearest sonne aliue wherefore he thus laments and makes great mone his brothers dead and he is left alone if mischiefe him befall vpon the way you bring my head to graue with sorrow gray the dearth grows great corns spent iacob in vaine them bids for foode to egypt hast againe we dare not see say they the princes face except our youngest brother be in place we straight will goe so him with vs thou send but ah saith iacob what did you intend by telling of the man you had a brother alas saith iudah how could we doe other he of our state and kindred did inquire saying what liueth yet your aged sire haue you a brother yet we told him so ah how could we what he intended know but send the lad with vs we instantly will bring you food for all your family i am his surety him of me require for euer let me beare thy blame and ire except i bring him backe the fault is thine else we returned had the second time father saith ruben let my sonnes be slaine except i safe doe bring him home againe as in some siege when famine growes so great that mothers their owne children deare doe eat one close her dearest darling vp doth hide lest others her compell it to diuide and rather chooseth eun to sterue and pine then cleaue her tender infant in the chine so when the famine now growes grieuous sore in iacobs house and like still to be more he steruing rather chooseth to abide then part with his deare darling from his side but when he saw himselfe and all his race with dearest beniamin in equall case that all for want of bread must sterue and dy except from egypt they had new supply he said to them since needes it must be so a present of my hands take ere you goe balme spice and myrrhe with best fruits of the land take likewise double money in your hand and that brought backe returne as it is right it may be it was but some ouersight and take your brother with you and arise god send you fauour in the princes eyes to free my simeon and this my delight thus of my children i am robbed quite with that he poured out a floud of teares but hungry stomackes had nor eyes nor eares but tooke the spice and money in their hand and haste with beniamin to egypts land from hebron three dayes iourney passe they right to memphis where they lodged all that night early n the morning when as ioseph sate dispatching suitors and affaires of state amongst the other suitors in the hall he first one of his brethren spyes then all but most his dearest beniamin he eid and therefore bids his steward soone prouide and take those hebrewes to some priuate roome for he would haue them dine with him at noone tis fit that those whom god to place doth call should be to strangers kind and hospitall then brought to iosephs house they are affraid the money to their charges should be laid when iudah thus the money we did finde in our sacks mouths when we did them vnbinde we haue brought backe with money eke to buy new corne for vs and all our family peace saith the man your fathers god you sent that treasure i was paid and well content and forthwith simeon out vnto them brought who each saluting other as they ought enquire at first of one anothers wealth but simeon chiefly of his fathers health then are they to a stately parlour brought all hangd with curious arras richly wrought by iosephs bride to whom he had made knowne his kindred there in curious colours showne for as her lord so she no time mispends but duely with her maides her worke intends lo ioseph is the paterne of her life thus a good husband alwaies makes a wise the deluge in the first peece was containd where but the arke nought on the flouds remaind but they abated lo there commeth forth all liuing ceeeping things vpon the earth with such varietie and cunning wrought as plainer folkes them liuing would haue thought so skilfull art doth nature imitate the dogges doe seeme to runne the lambs to bleate here noah offreth on an altar built of all cleane beasts to cleanse sinnes foulest guilt good sem arphaxad selah of whose race came heber whence the hebrewes next had place and pelag next who first diuides the land reu serug nahor tarah next doe stand from whence comes blessed

deceaues and blessed straight flyes from his brothers wrath to laban where he both his daughters hath here he returnes whom soone as laban misses with anger he pursues but parts with kisses here wrestles he with god lo here he meetes his angry brother who him kindly greetes before one sheafe here ten sheaues seeme to fall here sunne and moone and starres it worship all here are ten brethren playing in the shadowes whilst all their flockes are mowing of the meadows like liuely shepheards all doe dance and sing that woods and hils with ecchos seeme to ring when comes a childe in partycolourd coat them to salute but all flye to his throat and like so many butchers bout a lamb seeke to bereaue him from his dearest dam of all the stories they did there behold this had most life for iosephs wife had told with her owne hands it here so cunningly a man would thinke he saw the picture cry and on his knees with vnfeignd innocence to begge his life of their maleuolence this made their eyes those curious sights forbeare and gastly one vpon another stare and so amazd them they now surely thought god all their wickednesse to light had brought but now that ioseph is returnd they heare therefore their present ready they prepare as abram when he had recouered his kinsman lot and captiues with him led returning by the way with bread and wine was met by great melchizedek diuine and blessed for that god now by his hand had saud the prince and people of the land eun so good ioseph who by paines not sword had saud aliue thegyptians and their lord and daily from fierce famine succored such as had died else for want of bread was met with presents comming to his hall and blest as the preseruer of them all amongst the rest these hebrewes louting low their present offer him who straight would know how they did all and if their father old liud still in health of whom they last him told and what is this your brother young said he of whom you told mee they all answerd yea god blesse my sonne saith ioseph and retires to weepe for ioy now hauing his desires but washings eyes and face he doth refraine and to his brethren soone returnes againe so calls for meate he by himselfe alone thegyptians by themselues are placd each one his brethren by themselues for egypts nation are ranked as their ages doe require which made them this due order all admire to all then from his board he messes sends but fiue to one on beniamins he spends lo thus they all eate drinke and made good cheare till they had drownd all sorrow griefe and care but ioseph who amidst his feasts doth minde those that abroad for hunger sterud and pinde thinkes of his father old and doth command his steward for to fill streight out of hand the hebrews sacks so full as they can thrust and put their moneys in their sacks as first and in the youngests sacke his siluer cup so in the morning ere the sunne was vp they with their camels laden are let go but ere they thence are gone a mile or two vp gets the steward and them after hies whom ouertaking thus aloud he cryes ah why haue you rewarded ill for good my master of his grace hath giun you food and you his cup wherein he drinketh wine and wont to prophecie and to diuine purloined haue oh it is euill done good sir saith ruben thinke not any one of vs would doe such thing the money found last time when we our sackes at home vnbound was brought to thee againe most truly told how should we then or siluer steale or gold dye let him wheresoeuer it is found wee bondmen to my lord for euer bound he saith the steward shall be bound where wee the cup shall finde the other shall goe free then taking downe their sackes they doe begin to search from ruben eun to beniamin there was it found then all their clothes rend and backe againe vnto the citie tend as theefes who by the owner ouertake in fresh pursuit with goods about them take and brought before the iudge all mercy cry without defence for such their felony so they to ioseph brought before him fall and only vnto him for mercy call what haue you done saith he know you not i am able to diuine and prophecie ah iudah saith what shall thy seruants say or doe how can we cleare our selues this day god hath made plaine thy seruants wickednesse we are thy bondmen all we must confesse as likewise he with whom the cup was found nay god forbid saith ioseph he be bound who had the cup the rest depart in peace to your old father haste why doe you cease my lord saith iudah we haue no defence yet let me speake one word without offence at our last beeing heere thou didst inquire of this our brother and our aged sire and we thy seruants true and plainly told we haue a father which is very old who also in his age begat our brother the only childe aliue now of his mother his brothers dead and therefore more beloud by this my lord then answerd shall be proud the truth of all your sayings bring him hither that i may see the brethren all together we answerd if the lad should but depart from his old father it would kill his heart my lord replid except he to this place with you returne forbeare to see my face we comming home this to our father show who to buy corne againe would haue vs goe but wee replid except the lad we place before the man wee may not see his face ah saith our father you my sonnes well know that i had by his mother onely two ones dead and gone if this away you haue you bring my head with sorrow to the graue now if thou vs vnto my father send without the lad on whom his dayes depend soone as our father misseth him he dyes and we be authors of his miseries besides i suretie for the lad became and if i bring him not must beare the blame how shall i then my fathers face behold without the lad be there except i would bring on my fathers house such wrechednesse as no mans tongue is able to expresse with that like iordanes flouds his teares doe fall and as he wept so wept his brethren all but ioseph then no longer could refraine but biddes forbeare there may not one remaine within with him whilst he himselfe declares vnto his brethren with such cryes and teares that the egyptians and pharoh heare his loud laments and scarcely can forbeare to mourne with him who kept them all from mourning but ioseph to his brethren soone returning saith i am ioseph doth my father liue feare not my brethren i you all forgiue as when a king that he discouer may some traitrous plot his body doth array in such an habit as none can descry him from one of that close conspiracy till hearing all the traitours coniuring he shewes himselfe to be their lord and king so that they all stand mute and in a maze and gastly one vpon another gaze so stand the ten one looking on another to see so high their late betraied brother thus at the last the wicked men shall hide their face at sight of him they crucifide when on his throne his glory they behold like iosephs who shall like to him be sold but beniamin poore harmelesse innocent after he had endurd this chastisement at hearing iosephs name lifts vp his eyes and lowder now for ioy then sorrow cryes so shall the innocent at last appeare to be absolued by their brother deare then ioseph saith my brethren all draw neare i am your brother ioseph doe not feare that very ioseph you to egypt sold but be not greeud therewith nor doe it hold a cruell thing for god me sent before for to preserue your liues with millions more this is the second yeare fiue are behinde when none shall reape or mow or sheaues vp binde god sent me to preserue your progeny and saue you by a great deliuery not you i say but god me hither sent and made me here to your astonishment great pharohs father and giun free command ore all his house and ouer all his land hast to my father tell him in a word thus saith thy ioseph god hath made me lord of egypt tarry not but soone come downe and thou shalt dwell on goshens fruitfull downe thy children childrens children and thy flocke beasts asses camels all thy store and stocke lo there i sustenance for thee will finde for those fiue yeares of famine yet behinde your owne eyes see and beniamins behold i all in your owne tongue haue truly told my glory here then to my father tell as you haue seene and hither hast to dwell so weeping he vpon the necke doth fall of beniamin  and he on his so all he kisses and doth after with them talke familiarly as they together walke as when a treasure in the earth is found fames trumpet doth it farre and neere resound so fame this newes in pharohs court doth tell which pleased him and all his seruants well therefore he thus to ioseph out of hand thy brethren send with corne into their land to bring their father and his family that they may eate my lands fertilitie besides i will my charrets thou command for to conuey your father to my land with wiues and children let them leaue their stuffe egypt shall furnish them with store enough then ioseph hasting them away to send peace by the way doth thus to them commend i will not now things past commemorate your griefe and sorrow more to aggrauate for god hath turnd your morne of griefe and sadnesse vnto a day of feasting ioy and gladnesse yet patiently my louing counsell heare and by your former harmes learne to beware let not that wicked enuyer of mankinde breede discords strifes or quarrels in your minde nor question or dispute one with another whos most in fault for selling of your brother each of his sinne vnfainedly repent and giue god glory who me hither sent and all the euill you against me thought turning to good this great deliuerance wrought i send now charrets by the kings command to bring my aged father to this land ten asses laden all with egypts good i likewise send my father for his food and ten sheasses lade with corne and bread that by the way you may thereof be fed changes of rayment i to each assigne these fiue my dearest beniamin are thine with these three hundred siluer peeces so he hath his right yet you no wrong i do let not your eye cause i am good be ill tis reason good enough to say i will yet nature may informe you of another he is my onely brother by my mother enuy him not because he in mine eyes most gracious is nor shall he you despise brethren in loue and amitie combind are like small stickes we in a fagot bind no force them bends whilst they remaine in one disioynd a child will breake them all alone hast fareyouwell fall not out by the way woffend against my father by your stay lo thus they flie from nile to iordans shore to tell their father all you heard before ioseph is yet aliue saith iudah and is gouernor of all king pharohs land alas saith iacob come you me to flout ioseph now liues in heaun i make no doubt he was the prey long since of cruell beast i haue his bloody coate still in my chest ah saith dan to gods glory we confesse who hath laid open all our wickednesse that we our brother out of enuy fold when we at dothan pastured our fold to ishmaelites who after for their gaine in egypt where we found him sold againe his colourd coate which doth with thee abide we dipt in bloud our fowlest sinne to hide lo now thy sonnes on knees before thee fall and for this our offence beg pardon all ioseph vnaskd our trespasse did remit therefore good father also pardon it as indian merchant on the sodaine told his ship is safe arriud all lade with gold which long since to be cast away he feard because he neuer tidings of her heard first wauers and it hardly can beleeue fearing lest he too sodaine credence giue but when he sees the porters bringing in the golden oare and ingots doth begin for to reuiue eun so old israel misdoubts when first he heard his children tell of iosephs life and glory great at nile but when he thus had wauered awhile and saw the goodly charrets ioseph sent to bring him and his houshold from their tent to egypt and his dearest beniamin confirmd it all for truth behold within the old mans spirit doth againe reuiue and cryes with ioy ioseph is yet aliue god pardon you all your iniquitie i will goe downe and see him ere i die the end of the third booke of ioseph the fovrth booke of ioseph now iacobs tents abound with such great store of corne which they had wanted heretofore as if god had heauns windows opened and to his chosen thence had rained bread which he as librally participates vnto his neighbours and confederates of whom then taking leaue soone as he might he to bersheba iourneyed that night full twenty miles where freed from heathen eyes he to his god might offer sacrifice and saith thus to his sonnes this is the place where the egyptian agar first found grace when as gods angell made her see the well which saud the life of her and ishmael here let vs vp to god an altar reare for sacrifice that god which did appeare to abraham and isaacke also may to vs appeare as well vpon our way and in our iourney vs direct aright then in a dreame and vision of the night when sleepe his bodyes senses seized all god to his soule doth iacob iacob call i am the god vnto thy fathers knowne then feare not into egypt to go downe for i will goe with thee and make thee there a mighty people therefore do not feare but they shall come againe and iosephs hand shall close thine eyes in the egyptian land then early from bersheba all arose and in the waggons all themselues dispose sixty seun which with ioseph and his sonnes before in egypt iust to seunty comes leauing the high montanous craggy hills of pharan neare tharabian rocky shells vpon their left hand bend downe on the right to that which the egyptian sea is hight where a plaine way from thence to egypt guides ore sihor which from canaan it diuides by south as great euphrates doth diuide chalde by north from canaans fruitfull side here iacob who doth all occasions take gods promise certaine to his sonnes to make thus tells them by this riuers is bordered the land god promised to abrams seede from this egyptian riuer all the lands kin are giun vs eun to great euphrates sands a king of iudahs seed one day shall raigne gen called there the riuer of egypt a cittie so called ore all from sihor to the riuer maine sihor on south shall border iudahs side euphrates dan so sure as god did guide ioseph to egypt to prouide vs graine he to this land will bring vs backe againe then by this prouerbe men shall vnderstand from dan vnto bersheba all the land oh how can you incredible this deeme who haue in egypt iosephs glory seene that harder was then this to bring to passe this promisd but that neuer hoped was then fording sihor they through kedar past a countrey barren sauage wild and wast calld so of kedar sonne of ishmael here iacob eke occasion seekes to tellgen of gods great goodnesse them a land to giue not fruitlesse barren where the dwellers liue as here of couin rapine theft and spoile but a most pleasant and well watered soyle where plenty both of corne and wine do grow a land which doth with milke and honey flow besides what cause haue we our god to praise who vs conducts throgh these most dangerous waies amidst these robbers without feare or dread as late he at bersheba promised there was a cittiecalled ostracina or cheres built of costly matter a goodly outside but it wanted water like to a lampe that shineth faire and bright but wants the oyle that should maintaine the light or like some outside gallants complement that lacks minds inward grace and ornament from kedar passing towards casius mount they vp vnto a goodly citty mount where stood a goodly temple dedicate to iupiter thence casius nominate not that huge mount which doth in syria lie which one reports to be neare foure miles high plin lib cap this citty eun on egypts border stands and is the vtmost of the hagarian lands here iacob grieues at the abhomination of his neare kindred and his neighbour nation his vnckle ishmael who with him came by hagar from the loynes of abraham and in his flesh receiud the circumcision but falne to foulest heathenish superstition oh my deare sonnes beware i speake to all how you to foule idolatry doe fall leauing that god which made the heauns alone to worship idoles made of wood and stone and by religion of mans vaine deuising adore moone planets starres fire and sunrising how are we bound aboue all other nations to blesse god for our often preseruations but most for that god vs hath giun his light and chosen vs to worship him aright this idole whom these heathen casius name with hammon iupiters the very same in canaan worshipt eun that cursed cham from whence the cananites receiue their name whom holy noah in malitious pride as ishmael good isaacke did deride now fiue times had auroras tresses bright chased away the shadowes of the night since iacob came from hebron with his traine and now was iournying on his way againe to egypt when thus ruben doth begin that place where we last lodged is the in where gad his money in his sacke did finde when he for prouender did it vnbinde lo there before vs is the fruitfull downe of goshen there aboue is ramsis towne not one more pleasant spacious fruitfull plaine for pasture is in all the world againe there pharohs pleasure is that we shall keepe our camels asses all our flockes and sheepe not ten miles thence are those two citties great which pharoh houlds for his imperiall seate the one calld on egypts metropolis the other memphis whose large circuit is by measure seuenteene miles and more about but on is three miles larger out of doubt one with three thousand paces measure may betwixt these two huge citties the midway theres iosephs country house whence to the court he at his ease and pleasure may resort whether the king lye at his memphian bowers or in his stately ons more princely towers if god shall guide vs on our iourney right thou mayst see yet thy iosephs face ere night then iacob sends out iudah from that place to ioseph rightly to direct the face of iacob and of all his sonnes and traine and hasten backe to bring him word againe then ioseph takes his chariot for to meete his aged father and him duely greete as when good iacob at mahanaun met gods host in order like an army set when esau threatned his last ouerthrow so doth the glory of these worthies show iosephus ad heroum oppidum iacobo occurrit ios lib antiq ca when they do both in goshens plaine appeare and each vnto the other draweth neare ioseph begins to welcome his great sire and iacob iosephs glory doth admire and but they idol worship both abhorred they one another surely had adored as when this iacob after twenty yeares with laban spent to isaacke ould appeares they each in other wondrously delight so do these worthyes two in mutuall sight ioseph forgets his honour and his state and weepes on iacobs necke eun as he sate and israel forgets he was his sonne and as did ioseph would to him haue done clouds may not muses can expresse their teares so long forbearance mutually endeares them each to other but old israel to ioseph saith since i may with thee dwell and see thee in such great prosperitie lo willingly i am content to die so haue i seene a faire and tender lambe purloynd by wicked hand from louing dam long mist at last when both do meete againe with louing bleatings fill both hills and plaine iosephus ibidem yea so thold man with ioy was extaside it wanted little but he there had dide but pious ioseph with great care and paine by chafing brought him to himselfe againe both being then in iosephs chariot plast iacob begins thus with gods fauours past many all done by chance and fortune deeme and little of gods prouidence esteeme i wish such would in all my life obserue how all mens actions here gods purpose serue it was not chance made esau set at nought his birthright for a messe of potage bought nor the deuise alone of my deare mother that got my fathers blessing from my brother fors anger kindled thus it forth me driues to laban where i children get and wiues twas labans churlishnesse and auarice inrichd me by a new and strange deuice colours before his yeaning ewes to spread which made white sheepe bring lambs discoulered these he to me for wages did allow and suddenly they to a number grow the murmuring of labans sonnes constraine me with my household to hast home againe whom laban followes with an angry hart but god vs made good friends before we part lo esaus feare at peniel by night brought me to wrestle with the lord of might whose blessing so away his fury chases he turnes his threates to kisses and embraces simeon and leui cruell instruments from sichem made me to remoue my tents to bethel where my house of idolls cleard i vp an altar to thalmightie reard and payd my tenth as i to him did sweare when first from esaus wrath i fled or feare and saw a ladder which from earth did tend to heaun whereby the angels did descend now last thy brethrens enuy spite and hate by selling thee haue saud my life and state for but for thee we all had perished amongst the cananites for want of bread that god causd all these things it is most cleare for in the most he did to me appeare as late when i to egypt should descend thus all doth on gods prouidence depend long did i thee as dead lament and plaine and neuer hopd to see my sonne againe and so did isaack thy deare gransire grieue but neuer would that thou wert dead beleeue in god he was so confident and bold and in the dreames which thou before hadst told as if though blind he had foreseene this day but now in heauenly ioyes he liues for ay some ten yeares since him dying in his bed i and my brother esau buried oh my deare sonne my soule is much delighted as to relate eun so to heare recited gods goodnesse towards his therefore vnfould how god preserud thee since thy brethren sold thee to the ishmaelites for thrice seun yeare are past since i least newes of thee did heare good iacob had no sooner made an end but ioseph was as as ready to commend gods care and goodnesse in his preseruation from all his troubles in this next narration i know not whether by their fault or fate it oft befalleth great men in the state rich wise and happy in their princes grace comely in body beautifull in face to be conioyned to a wanton wife which sowreth all the sweetnesse of their life this was the fault or fortune of a peare of pharohs to the king his master deare my master potiphar who as i weene had in his youth a skilfull merchant beene and stewarded so frugally his owne that pharoh wise to whom all this was knowne mad him chiefe steward they that can hold fast their owne their masters treasure seldome wast he that did by experience vnderstand how things are hoist vp bought at second hand hearing that merchants stord with spicery were come to towne goes his owne selfe to buy the king his masters and his owne prouision thrift stands not on nice courtlike superstition amongst some other wares then to be sold a faire young hebrew lad he doth behold adornd and set out in the fairest guise as horses to be sold at higher prize a price once pitchd and i by running tride as some do horses ere they buy them ride was sold to potiphar who for his table me bought as we our horses for our stable i of this change was most exceeding glad for now i ease for paine and trauell had for hard fare good but as a gratefull minde returnes ay thankes where benefits they finde so did i my good lords munificence requite with industry and diligence and for i found he pleasd my master best that pleasd my mistresse well aboue the rest i to obserue her was most diligent and all means vsde to giue her best content so that by prudence more then taking paine i both their loues and fauours sought to gaine for who so will obserue shall euer find best way to please is to obserue the mind and the affection of men of state and thereunto themselues accommodate therefore a blisse on good men to attend but misery on wicked to depend both proud by me who for my seruice true was by my lord preferd to honour due and for like seruice to my wicked dame was brought to prison obloquy and shame this my faire mistresse for no other name i giue her willing ay to hide her shame some meane mechaniques daughter seemes to be first matcht in her owne order and degree but raisd to wealth and honour from the dust thinks all to little for her pride and lust and as a man that stands on steeple high his equals erst doth now like crowes descry so she now clambred vp on honours spire thinkes all to low her greatnesse to admire soone might i in her scornfull lookes descry her haughtinesse and my base slauery but bearing then an honest gentle minde omit no seruice that may fauour finde which so succeedes that ere the crescent bright had fild her hornes with brothers borrowed light i by my diligence of her did gaine sweet smiling lookes in stead of proud disdaine and now the enuious spirit which sought of late to ruine by my fathers loue my state me by my mistresse lust seekes to intrappe and dandle in vile sinfull pleasures lappe damnd sparke of hell base counterfet of loue and those pure warming flames from heaun aboue which so true louers hearts in one vnite that they enioy without offence delight therefore true loue like morne is faire and bright lust like an ympe begot of blackest night but later dayes since rapines did abound do lust and loue most wickedly confound this baser lustfull loue the spirit did chuse as he did first the serpent to abuse the weaker eue this proudest dame to traine to tast the fruit forbidden by deaths paine and kindling in her eyes first lustfull fire this sense presents it with her foule desire to reasons brighter eye which soone that flame makes to returne into her cheekes with shame reason with this base passion striued long put one weake as the other groweth strong but nought so checks her pride and courage braue as stooping to an hated hebrew slaue that she who now did sit in highest grace should thus her honour great and state debase as to become a vassall to her slaue pride many womens chastities doth saue but now the violence of lustfull flame had seard the reason of thegyptian dame who waiting till her lord to court was gone thus smiling set vpon me all alone faire hebrews sonne whose equall neuer i yet saw nor do i thinke sols searching eye in all his trauels from the east to west a beautie sees with thine fit to contest not that hereby i vnderprize mine owne mine no superiour thine hath neuer knowne an equall and though fates vs vp did reare in sundry climates yet since now appeare in one horison sunnes so equall bright lets each on other shine with mutuall light let thy bright beames vpon my beautie shine i on thee will reflect both thine and mine deare seruant do not thou my grace despise thee i alone can make to honour rise thou seest how potiphar alone doth stand in pharohs grace and rules both court and land to the i loue i dare be bold to say i potiphar the court and kingdome sway see then thy happinesse a slaue of late in me to rule all egypts glorious state and if the fates vs send a lucky heire which may like to his parents seeme most faire all hearts he by thy beautie shall command and by my right inherit all our land sweet ioseph let not frownings cloud thy face soure lookes thy glorious beautie do disgrace lets take thoccasion now we are alone as bodyes so our soules to ioyne in one so may we with good likelyhood suppose bright phebus with faire cynthia to close when ioyning for their mutuall delight they seeme eclipsed to the vulgars sight as when some lustfull prince alone vnseene doth tempt the faithfull handmaid of his queene to win her to his will and wicked lust the modest maid considring well the trust of her great dame whom if she so offended she iustly were of god and man condemned prayes and intreates his awfull maiestie her not to force to such iniquitie and breake the sacred lawes for lustfull rage of faithfull trust and holy marriage so i poore wretch whose fresh and youthfull chin fine softest downe to shadow did begin strangely amazd and grieud at this foule fact abhorring eun the offer as the act yet with all due respect and reuerence did shew my duty and obedience and thus replide deare mistresse you shall find me ready ay to satisfie your mind in all where i may iustly you obay and not my heauenly masters will gainsay my master all commits vnto my hand nor knoweth he how his owne state doth stand no man is greater in his house then i nor doth he to my custody denie ought but thy selfe because thou art his wife his onely comfort deare delight and life how can i to this sinne then condescend and not against my fathers god offend the simple rude saith she a sinne it call but here at court tis no offence at all those that are most seuere against this vice delight it most oh tis a deepe deuice of polititians to make a law to hold their children wiues and fooles in aw when they then keepe it nothing lesse intend but at their pleasures diuersly offend i know not one braue spirit in pharohs court that this esteems of other then a sport and yet their faire yong lusty able wiues must like reclused virgins leade their liues for my part i haue learned this by kind such measure as men meete vs they shall find then blushing she doth teares like pearles distill for she had teares and blushes at her will but i replide good madame be content i cannot to your arguments consent to proue from greatnesse lawfulnesse to euill is for to draw a paterne from the deuill who is the greatest worldly potentate yet no excuse tis him to imitate for great mens faults they are vnsearchd vnkowne to me i haue enough to mend my owne they that seuerely iudge sinne yet delight therein they iudge themselues and yet iudge right and who do thus gods iudgements iust abuse must neuer hope that greatnesse shall excuse will you because men wrong your sexe offend your maker god such wickednesse defend embrace true chastitie of flesh and mind which honours men and graceth womankind but notwithstanding she from day to day me wooes yet would i not her voyce obay but shund by all good meanes her company till one day she occasion did espy i being in my closet all alone and in the house not of the houshold one then all inragd with fury heate and lust like hungry hawke that hath a partridge trust she on my garment ceasde immodestly and cride come sleepe with me or else i die not rachels losse my brethrens rage nor yet the feare of famine lying in the pit nor midians bondage did me so perplexe as now this womans furious lust doth vexe who as the cruell serpents said to wind about the noble elephant by kind so winds this wicked monster womans shame about me to my sorrow and her blame what shall i fly she me too fast doth hold shall i cry out for shame be it not told a manlike heart did for a woman cry oh who can but bewayle my misery should i but now to dalliance consent me followes honour pleasure worlds content but if that i this offerd grace reiect bondage disgrace a prison i expect but fearing more diuine reuenging hand then racke disgrace imprisonment or band taking more pleasure in a conscience sound then all wealth honours ioyes she did propound acquite my body though i left behind my garment and out of the rome doe winde so haue i seene some modest country maid with some vnciuill vsage much dismaid closely her aprons strings to escape vntie and left it with the clowne away to flie who can the leopards fell rage display chasing a pilgrim fast vpon the way and laying on his cloke her cruell pawes eun ready to deuoure him in her iawes who strucke with sudden terrour and affright forsakes his cloake and scapes by winged flight may tell the rage of this most cruell dame who now hath nothing left but spight and shame then raging that her beautie which she prizd aboue all others should be so despisd shee cals her seruants in and to them told how that base hebrew slaue was growne so bold and proud of hers and her deare husbands grace that now he did aspire into his place and would haue slept with her had she not cride all which his garment left here testifide which vp vntill her lords returne she laid then with my coate her malice she displaid for which my lord me into prison cast my daies in paine and miserie to waste thus lightly crediting the accusation and his false wifes most guilefull simulation he by his rashnesse lost a seruant iust and still maintaines a strumpets pride and lust but as a sixsquard dye or carued stone how euer cast stands still vpright all one so was i constant in aduersitie as resolute in my prosperitie that god which me had erst deliuered from brethrens fury and me honored in time of my vniust captiuitie me leaues not now in this calamitie oh happy they whose conscience them acquite that heere they suffer wrong for doing right so but a while gods leisure they attend they sure shall haue a good and happy end let tyrants rage they god as gentle kind in prison as in paradise doe finde wherefore though i was of my coate bereft my masters grace and fauour and now left in stinking dungeon yet i felt no harme god gaue me power my iailours hands to charme and sent me in the prisonkeepers sight fauour and grace for potiphars despight for now that former diligence which gaind mee fauour with my lord like trust obtaind mee in the prison so that to my care lo all the prisoners committed are the keeper lookes to nought vnder his hand god euer prospers all i did command about this season as it oft befals great fauorites in court haue suddaine falls by their owne faults or others accusation or by their lords dislike and alteration of fauorites two lords of high regard in pharohs court committed are to warde the keeper these doth to my trust commend that i with diligence should them attend these wanton courtiers which had formerly liud all in plentie ease and iollitie acknowledging nor seruing other god then pharoh and now chastned with his rod as without soules this change of fortune beare but i by all meanes sought my charge to cheare and told them if indeed they guiltlesse were the iustest king of heaun would finde them cleere and if they had through frailtie him offended so they their sinnes confessed and amended hee eun as willing was them to forgiue as they ins grace and fauour here to liue how earthly kings our bodies might enchaine but still our soules in freedome did remaine with many such good words i sought to please my charge who found therein no little ease and grew lesse heauy till both in one night had seuerall dreams which did them much affright which soone as i had heard i right aread and as i told so all things followed such visions are not like dreames naturall which ordinary vs in sleepe befall they in our soules deeper impressions leaue then such as commonly the sense deceiue which in the fantasie worst reuell keepe when commonsense the master is a sleepe and doe th imagination vaine delight sometime with hope sometime with feare affright working most on th affections of the minde when sleepe the bodies senses fastest binde for eun in sleepe griefe ioy feare hope hate loue the soules affections wake and liuely moue god often by such visions tels men plaine what things they ought to doe and what refraine sometimes by dreames to them are promised great blessings and great curses threatened god oft thus shewes one his determination and giues another the interpretation thus vnto me two dreames by night he told which as they proue my grandsire did vnfold thus pharohs seruants first and next their king see things to come but the interpreting was giun to me which done i told them plaine interpreting to god as dreames pertaine and now who thinkes but that i thought it long yet two yeares to abide in prison strong after i had so well interpreted his dreame whom now the king so honored but hauing learnd with patience to attend gods leasure and to hope vnto the end eun at that time when as i least expected so long of pharohs cupbearer neglected he that doth all things heere by weight and measure on whom they all attend to doe his pleasure by one poore dreame but from an heathen king whats long before decreed to passe doth bring i raisd to grace the world from famine quite the butler doth acknowledge his oresight south sayers weakenesse is discouered and god is all in all acknowledged my brethren bold are to repentance brought for all the wickednesse which they had wrought and this my wicked mistris may reclame and bring her to acknowledgement with shame and make my master see his foolish passion and learne to iudge by better information my two first dreames proue true which i had told my fathers spirit reuiud now being old pharoh thus gaines the wealth of all his land and must acknowledge it from gods owne hand thus all the parts of this sweet sacred story are for mans good but end all with gods glory all these are now the consequence and theames of mine of pharohs and his seruants dreames see farther heere satans maleuolence and mans will freely serue gods prouidence satan sought by my brethrens crueltie in me to ruine isaacks family my brethren me of wilfull enuie sould and for the twentie siluer peeces told the midian merchants bought me for their gaine and into egypt meant to sell againe god hither sent me graine heere to prouide else thou and all thy sonnes for want had dide thus satan sought dishonour of gods name and all for this my brethren rightly blame goodmen such merchants couetise detest that buy and sell gods image as a beast but god whos only powrefull good and wise from all these euils makes the good arise but i thus hauing in great pharohs grace obtaind the first in realme the second place first pray to god me to direct aright to vse this fauour and my borrowed light nor sought i mine owne honour wealth and praise but his who did me from the dungeon raise and therefore first take care for publike good prouiding gainst the future famine food wherefore i first through egypt circuit ride and garners great in eury place prouide in those seun fruitfull yeares to fill with store of eury graine and sith it is no more vertue to purchase then preserue no tide i slipt but did most carefully prouide to kill all vermine cut off all excesse of gluttonie and beastly drunkennesse abate all needlesse beasts dogges mules and horse ridde idle rogues and vagrants which are worse then catterpillars to consume the store to rob the richest and to sterue the poore no corne out of the land let i goe out but buy in rather from the coasts about and many forrests which before did ly all waste i vnto tillage did apply thus i proceede and god so blest my hand that all things prosper ouer all the land but when the yeares of plentie all are past and all the land of egypt lyeth waste so that they liue of former yeares remaines which them perhaps a month or two sustaines the people first of pharoh seeke supply who them to ioseph sends i suddenly set ope the barnes and sell for money out the corne to all the nations round about now is the time indeed that i might buy castles and lands for my posteritie but i all money bring to pharohs hand to be the strength and sinewes of the land if pharoh will bestow on me a place or money to buy land i of his grace will house and land as i my office hold strangers in purchasing may be too bold when all their moneys spent with buying bread one yeare with corne i them for cattell fedde but when the next yeare they in neede doe stand i will for corne their bodies buy and land but all for pharoh whereby growing strong he and his empire may continue long and to establish more his segnurie from place to place i will each colonie transplant who on the east of nile abide i will remoue vnto the other side thus pharoh lord of egypt shall be knowne by seisin none shall say this is mine owne thus haue i seene when want or waste compell a gallant his inheritance to sell lest any right in him should still be thought giue place to him that hath the purchase bought and in another countrie dwelling hire whether he with his houshold may retire thus will i doe with all the common lands but for the sacred in the prophets hands to muses and to learning dedicate or to religious vses consecrate i thinke it sacriledge indeed to touch could all by this example learne as much and let the priests their portions freely eate whose braines in youth for vnderstanding sweate their age in prayers and perswasions spend to saue the good and wicked to amend when i seaun yeares haue furnisht them with bread i in the eighth will furnish them with seede to sowe their land the fifth of whose increase shall be the kings the other foure in peace they and their housholds eate and this shall stand for euer as a law in pharohs land the priests lands only shall be euer free for to the lord they consecrated bee now as i said when i did circuit ride and egypts land suruaid from side to side one thing of greatest vse i did obserue which doth perpetuall memory deserue which if it once were rightly vnderstood would force all studious of the publique good to doe speake write of this most rare inuention till to effect they brought what next i mention a peece of land an istmos barre or stay

this day from dangers me preserued this god me from the dungeon deepe did raise to be thy husband him for euer praise madame your king and father are content but your owne mouth must shew your free consent when fairest asenah long silence breakes and as an angell sent from heaun thus speakes good sir such is my due and filiall awe my fathers iudgement is to me a law much more my soueraignes but such worth in you i see and heare of i should rather sue but for my sexes bashfull modesty for such an honour rather then deny nor shall i meanely of my selfe thus deeme to honour him whom king and realme esteeme their father and the kingdomes fauourite what greater grace befals a mortall wight sir that religion which my holy sire taught me his child informd my soules desire worlds glory pompe and vainenesse to despise but thy religion makes men heaunly wise and brings them by an vpright conuersation to happy euer lasting habitation therefore as thy religion our transcends as aiming at more high and happy ends so greater is my ioy and happinesse to match where i it truly must professe so sure as that whereof thou didst diuine by dreames shall come to passe so am i thine thy god shall be my god and mine thy nation in earth graue heaun one be our habitation what thou approust as good the same doe i with thee sweete hebrew let me liue and dye pardon a womans tongue knowes no content yea

diuide deare daughter i to ioseph thee commit thou therefore must thy fathers house forget and people so shall sonnes before thee stand fit to beare rule as princes in the land that god whom pharoh on and ioseph serue who as he all things made doth all preserue god who of things to come to pharoh told by dreames which none but ioseph could vnfold when god him from the dungeon did aduance to saue vs by a great deliuerance god authour sole and end of happinesse this holy marriage and this vnion blesse of the egyptian and the hebrew nations and make them happy in their generations and honour ay in heaun our souraigne king as he his seruants honours in this thing the king thus pleasd in royall pompe and state with sumptuous feasts and showes doth celebrate our marriage day where all with musique rings and king and court a happy hymen sings happy i hope though with an heathen dame whose grace and vertues i the rather name that you may know we here as elsewhere finde some good as well as bad of womankind as a loose wicked wife of potiphar so a most pious childe of putiphar but why should i time in her praises spend since her owne workes her best of all commend god me hath giun by her two louely boyes before the famine which are all my ioyes lo here shee kindly comes with all her traine her welcome father for to entertaine for now they all at iosephs gate arriue where pharohs peares and seruants all doe striue how best their loues and seruice shew they may to adde more honour to this happy day when asenah first kneeling downe begun oh holy father of a blessed sonne blesse me thy daughter blessed shall they be whom thou dost blesse as welcome now to me as dearest ioseph to his fathers sight all egypts glory yeelds not such delight when iacob daughter fitter tis for me to your great state to bow my humble knee but rightly you of me a blessing craue no other dower to bestow i haue the lord on thee from heaun all blessings shower but iacobs tongue not hauing farther power now to expresse his wondrous ioy and loue his eyes produce abundant teares to proue his ioyfull soule for iosephs happy state when iosephs steward tells him it was late and supper time wherefore they all addrest themselues in their due order to the feast the fifth booke of ioseph soone as aurora with her blushing face vsherd the gyant out to run his race his longest iourney from the east to west good ioseph though he ouernight did feast eun all thastates of egypt with their traine his father in more state to entertaine gets vp and with his seruants all repaires vnto a chappell by to publike praiers which pharoh had giun ioseph there to serue god who from famine egypt did preserue no time to men of action is so free for their deuotions as the mornings bee especially for those that liue at court where they make dinners long but prayers short but they done ioseph doth his speech direct thus to his brethren you perhaps expect that i now for mine owne and houses grace should raise you all to honourable place and make you lords at least in pharohs land but if you wisely things will vnderstand and know that honour ladeth more then graces if wealth and vertues answer not your places no grace nor honour can giue such contents to you as quietly to liue in tents you that haue had your breeding in such sort cannot obserue the niceties of court they whose ambition would be ouer all the higher climbd oft take the greater fall equals enuy superiours such disdaine inferiours maligne all seeke their gaine grace and preferment by anothers frowne who get vp seeke to thrust the other downe courtiers are dials whilst sol on them shines obserud of all else but as painted lines many courthonour onely do admire and as another heaun on earth desire these onely looke on outward splendour showne our inward cares and dangers are vnknowne none would enuy our glory and content knew they the weight and cares of gouernment they altas burthen on their shoulders brare to whom committed is the publique care besides most stand in such high slippery places i would not haue their hazard for their graces i speake not to dehort from gouernment the wise for feare of griefes and discontent vnder this burthen they must bow their backe lest if the wicked rule all goes to wracke but who are prudent moderate and wise are rather raisd for worth then seeke to rise and such like tubs on their owne bottome stand nor neede the least support of others hand when they which want this true worth of their owne no sooner clamberd vp but tumble downe the first like fixed starres stand firme and fast last make faire showes like comets but sonne wast their matter is pure elementall fire of these ambitious humour and desire such is the humour of ambition vaine for grace and offices to take much paine wherein they neuer comfort take nor rest so feare of loosing doth their mind molest when could they their faire fortunes vse aright they freedome might enioy with much delight i fiue of you my brethren will present to pharoh who i know hath an intent to giue you any honour you require but you his fauour onely shall desire and tell him plainely how you haue been bred and heards and cattell all your life time fed my reason is for that this occupation is here in egypt of small reputation desiring you of his high grace may hold some pastures onely for your flocks and fold where you may serue god free from care and strife and pray for pharohs long and happy life should i you all now raise to dignitie ones folly ruine might the family many vnited stronger are then one but tis most what more safe to stand alone especially so high where one mans fall may make a breach and so indanger all oh happinesse if knowne of country bowers where in deuotion they their freer howers may spend and with groues citizens sweet sing diuinest praises to the heaunly king where free from plots and vndermining arts all may the truth speake boldly from their hearts for to a goodman tis no little paine to flatter for the greatest grace and gaine there may they see their lambs grow great and more and heauenly blessings on their stocke and store there may they see corne thriue vpon their lands and god to prosper all workes passe their hands happy whose lot falls in so faire a ground such pleasures are at court but seldome found but lets make hast my brethren to the court my businesse is long my time but short and now had phoebus climbd vp to such height his beames did warme the world as well as light when israell old with trauell wearied slept sound till waking he much wondred thinking himselfe at first in his owne tents to see such costly gorgeous ornaments but soone remembring where he did abide he turnes to leah lying by his side and thus begins deare wife should i suruay gods blessings from my birth vnto this day and in a summe his benefits recount they would my dayes nay eun my howres surmount his goodnesse wisedome foure loue in those past shind seuerall but all now in this last goodnesse in drawing so much good from ill to worke the sound good purpose of his will his powre herein is manifestly showne in raising vp the meeke and throwing downe the prowd his heauenly wisedome did foresee and told vs all by dreames which now we see the starres eleun to ioseph bowd long sence now we the sunne and moone him reuerence and lastly here appeares his wondrous loue that all fors glory and our good doth proue thus israel doth gods benefits recite beginning in the morning eun till night but whilst he thus gods bounty magnifide like fairest ewe with twin lambs by each side comes asenah on either hand a sonne smugge liuely like two rabbets newly run which seemd their mothers gracefull steps to guide as two trim squires that leade to church a bride the tender boyes whose mothers pious care before had taught themselues aright to beare downe on their knees before their grandsire fall and sweetly to him for his blessing call the good old man whose heart doth dance for ioyes to see his nephews thus begins sweete boyes which like two fairest iuly flowers showne or buds of damaske roses scarcely blowne oh these my daughter giue you more content then egypts wealth and costliest ornament me thinks they hang vpon each arme of thine like two faire clusters on a fruitfull vine these shall renew our dying memory and vs reuiue vnto posteritie behold i see in little ephraims face my dearest rachels louely lookes and grace manasses like to ioseph doth appeare who aboue all his brethen was my deare but oh my daughter how much am i bound to you for vndeserued fauours found but ioseph more a princesse of your state so lowly to descend to be his mate god make him worthy of your grace and loue and that he may as acceptable proue to you his deare as he was wont be blest with highest fauours alwayes of the best for he at home in bondage prison court in grace was alwayes with the better sort i potiphar the gaoler and the king best loud and trusted him in euery thing then asenah i wish you were obserued here my deare father as you haue deserued as for your sonne no noblenesse of birth nor egypts dowers can counteruaile his worth who me hath taught the vanity of state me worthy make as happy of my mate such is his worth and noblenesse of mind i wonder not that he should fauour find amongst the best but shall i you intreate to tell your daughter what you vse to eate for here you all must as at home command we but desire your will to vnderstand daughter saith iacob i was neuer nice nor dainty to consume things of high price thats alwayes best you easiliest can prepare better are homely cates then forraine fare my heards my foode my sheepe my clothing breade no better weare i nor no other feede sixe score and ten yeares haue i beene content to liue on milke fruits and such nourishment yet few or none that to mine age attaine so strong of body are and free from paine but aboue all the weather being faire i loue to walke abroad in freshest aire after my mornings draught to stirre is good for to refresh the spirits and warme the blood this is the way diseases to preuent i thanke god i neere knew what phisicke ment thus whilst they talke in plaine familiar sort lo ioseph vnexpected comes from court and tells his father how he did present his brethren to the king who is content them to employ according to their breeding in looking vnto sheepe and cattell feeding and now he much desires to see your face and with all courtly honour you to grace i iacob saith with all my heart will goe to that good king that ioseph honours so but i desire of him no greater grace then to liue in his land and see thy face i hope he likewise will conceiue my breeding and leaue me to my flockes and cattell feeding ioseph his father then to pharoh brings who doing first obeisance due to kings begins oh blessed blest thou euer be that raisd my ioseph to such dignitie from dungeon where stockes did his limbs enroule and yrons enterd eun into his soule to rule all egypt by thy borrowed might and be alone great pharohs fauorite and blest be ay for thy benignitie who sauest me and all my family from perishing alas for want of food god render in thy bosome all thy good and double thy forefathers daies vpon thee and thy seede that sit vpon thy throne thus ends the sage when pharoh thus replide how much more cause haue i to blesse the tide that noble ioseph did to egypt driue to saue me and my people all aliue come hither iacob let me thee embrace how can i but loue thee and all thy race whom now as cause and author i doe see oh ioseph father of all mine and mee it ioyes me israel most exceedingly when i thy sonne in ought can gratifie to whom my kingdome life and all i ow as thou and thine and all the people know god sent thy ioseph as a man before to lay vp here against this famine store for had we not by his foresight beene fed we thou and all for want had perished thy ioseph doth informe my senatours and wisedome teach vnto my counsellours well may he rule then ore my house and land and all my substance haue at his command i am to this by prouidence but led god hath indeed thus ioseph honored thou seemst of no lesse wisedome and defert then good old father tell how ould thou art and in what course thou hast worne out this terme i aske not to examine but to learne examples more then precepts teach to liue good king saith iacob thou doest eun reuiue my older age to heare thy wondrous loue to ioseph whom more then my selfe i loue but seeing thou inquirest of mine age know that the dayes here of my pilgrimage a hundred and full thirty yeares haue beene the dayes are few and ill which i haue seene nor haue i yet attained to the age and dayes of my forefathers pilgrimage two things i studdy here especially the first to liue well second well to die for what is all our life once gone and past but eun a way vnto our happy last the terme from whence to all flesh is the wombe that whither all doe hasten is the tombe he happiest here who findeth on the way fewest impediments his course to stay some passe through sicknesse pouerty some wealth honour preferment pleasure strength and health some equally of both participate this is the meane yet safe and happiest fate the highest i did euer here aspire and in this state i still to liue desire the highest honours to your grace are due for god hath with a kingdome honourd you whereof you haue your selfe most worthy showne in looking to gods glory not your owne wisely therefore i speake it to your praise you honour them whom god would haue you raise and in your kingdome prudently depresse those whom god hateth for their wickednesse thus needs your gouernment must happy be when king and senatours in one agree the proud to cast downe and to raise the iust so may the rulers one another trust god that from famine vs deliuered and by a dreame foretold thee counselled both for thy land and houshould to prouide and all the world which else for want had dide feede thee with inward and spirituall grace and giue in heaun an euerlasting place for this i your poore beadsman night and day will in a homely countrey cottage pray pharoh much ioyd would faine haue entertaind and him at his owne boord with bread sustaind but good old iacob modestly denide and sayd how long haue i on earth to bide i cannot now of good from ill make choyce nor musique iudge by instrument or voyce why should i be a burthen to the king and he reward so my smallmeriting but let my sonne for me before thee stand and ready alwayes be at thy command good man saith pharaoh i haue giun command to place thee in the fattest of my land the land of goshen be a habitation to thee thy children and thy generation there is best pastureground for them to keepe their camels asses cattell gotes and sheepe to raise to place of honour i desire thee and thy sonnes but they of me require still to be heardsmen wherefore the most bould and actiue i make rulers of my fould then iacob blessing pharoh did depart out of his presence with a ioyfull heart seunteene yeares after in prosperitie liud iacob and did greatly multiplie and ioseph in his former grace did stand still vnder pharoh ruling all the land nor might be ere out of his masters sight because he was his onely fauorite till one day ioseph absent from the court pharoh bespeakes his seruants in this sort nere thrise ten times the sunne with panting horse hath run through heaun his swift and yeerly course since first arose in this our hotter clime that hebrew sun which euer since did shine and all the time he did in court appeare we haue had spring and summer all the yeare i cannot eate by day nor sleepe by night without his beames most comfortable bright that honest man in whose ingenuous face a man may reade what in his heart hath place now by my life i higher doe esteeme this hebrew then great egypts diademe nor is it to the least of you vnknowne he hath beene better to me then my crowne and beares still for me to all mens content the weight of all my kingdomes gouernment in those seun yeares of famine and of store when his employments greater were and more if he were but one day out of my sight i certaine was to heare from him at night but now ofs light hath beene neere three daies pause yet no man here will tell to me the cause when thus the butler who by pharohs grace restord was as he dreamd tos former place dread soueraigne some small clouds do in this sort shadow his beames which wont to shine at court but no defect in his ayconstant light hes still the same and shines as euer bright ioseph at home for pharohs health now prayes to israels god these are his mourning dayes his father old now sleepes in happy rest who dying made to him this last request my dearest sonne the honour of my race if in thy sight thy father hath found grace for though thou art my sonne by true relation yea i am subiect to thy domination now graciously and truely with me deale not for my priuate but our common weale well do i know that our posteritie will soone admire faire showes and vanitie and not regard the land of happinesse the type of future and of present blesse therefore to me my dearest ioseph sweare thou wilt not me in egypt here enterre but safely carry to the land of rest with my forefathers there my bones to rest it may be ours will sooner hasten thither where all their fathers bones doe lye togither then ioseph sware and israel worshipped the feare of isaack sitting on his bed these words he me desird with many teares that i would publish in king pharohs eares and licence of thee to that end obtaine which done he would to court returne againe when pharoh thus is that good old man dead like apple ripe in autumne gathered we all must follow who can tell how soone some fall at night at morning some at noone but i desire if any here can tell how that good old man dide that liud so well for most what it befals mortalitie as they haue liued here eun so to dye good ioseph saith the butler thus me told that iacob growing weake as he grew old he ephraim and manasses his two sonnes takes with him and vnto his father comes wherewith his weakenesse greatly comforted he takes his strength and sits vp in his bed and thus begins my sonne my ioseph deare the god almightie did to me appeare at luz in canaan where he did me blesse and promise to my seede much fruitfulnesse assuring me to make a mightie nation and giue that land vnto my generation for those two sonnes god here hath giun to thee before my comming thou shalt giue them me as simeon and ruben they are mine thy children since begotten shall be thine these two i meane shall be two tribes the rest in these tribes names shall be of land possest for i a double portion thee allot as my first borne because i thee begot of rachel deare my first my lawfull wife who on my hand in canaan left her life her there alas i buried on the way to ephrata calld bethlem to this day but what are these two lads my ioseph deare my sonnes saith ioseph god first gaue me heere oh bring them me saith iacob to this place before i die to kisse blesse and embrace sweet boyes good ioseph i nere thought indeed to see thy face but now i see thy seede the old man then though he were dimme of sight his left hand on manasses and his right on younger ephraim layes and wittingly thus blesseth ioseph in his progeny god in whose sight i here haue walkd alway who all my lifelong fed me to this day the god of abram and great isaacks dread and th angell which hath me deliuered from euill blesse these lads and let my name with name of isaack and of abraham be in them namd and in their tribes renewd and grow on earth eun to a multitude but it displeasing was to iosephs sight to see on ephraims head him lay his right and on manasses his left hand to place and would his first borne with the right hand grace but iacob nould but said i know indeed thy firstborne shall be great but lo the seede of ephraim shall be greater farre then he and a more strong and mightie people be thus aged iacob blessd them both that day and said in thee let israel blesse and say god send thee ephraims and manasses store but ephraim he manasses set before then said he lo i die now out of hand and god shall bring you to your fathers land then ere he dide he swanlike sung this song most sweete because he liud not

where his forefathers were interred all thus when his swanlike song was at an end and all commanded that he did intend he plucked vp his feete into the bed and was vnto his people gathered oh happy man saith pharoh god me send eun such a life and such a happy end lo farther pharoh did that day command that all his peeres and nobles of the land should goe with ioseph and his brethren all to honour holy iacobs funerall where they seun dayes made so great lamentation they draue the cananites to admiration and after he was buried in this sort ioseph returnes againe to pharohs court his brethren vnto goshen where in peace they liued and did mightily increase till ioseph was an hundred ten yeares old so that he ephraims children did behold to their third generation and the seede of
